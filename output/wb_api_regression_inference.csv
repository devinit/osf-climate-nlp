The Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Development Policy Financing with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (DPF with Cat DDO), in the amount of Euro 165.4 million (US$200 million equivalent), will support the Government of Kenya’s (GoK) reform program to improve the country’s capacity to reduce disaster risks and improve management of the socioeconomic and fiscal impacts of disasters. The GoK has initiated a shift toward a more proactive approach to managing disaster and climate risks. This has involved taking systematic steps to develop a comprehensive approach to overall risk management, including addressing impacts of climate change (CC), to build programs and strategies that strengthen national response, and put in place contingency financing that will serve to improve post-disaster liquidity needed to meet emergency and recovery needs. Under the devolved governance structure that was established by the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the country’s forty-seven county governments play a key role in DRM1. The Constitution integrates key provisions on DRM including national level support to counties which are required to develop their respective DRM policies and programs in line with the National DRM Policy. Extreme climatic events have long posed a significant risk to Kenya, and contributed to increasing levels of vulnerability of the poor, smallholder farmers and pastoralists, whose livelihoods are threatened by increased variability of rainfall patterns, triggering episodes of acute food insecurity. Kenya is at an early stage of urbanization, but by 2050 about half of the population will be living in cities. Around 27 percent of Kenyans live in urban areas, and the country is urbanizing at about 4.3 percent a year. The urbanization process has been accompanied by increasing levels of urban poverty (60 percent of Kenya’s urban households live in slums), growth of informal settlements, poorly functioning land markets and institutions, and an incomplete legal and building regulatory framework. Historical factors underpinning land ownership have led to urban land market distortions and, today, these markets are having difficulty supporting sustainable urbanization. In addition, there is low technical capacity to enforce and to build resilient infrastructure, making the country and its population particularly vulnerable. Evidence of this is the proliferation of substandard buildings with poor services and insufficient infrastructure, with the collapse of more than 26 buildings in the last 20 years. Equally important is the exposure of urban areas to moderate seismic risk, due to the East African Rift running through west Kenya and fault lines that are present south of Mombasa.",0.26869833

The development objective of the Urban Institutional and Infrastructure Development Program Project for Ethiopia is to enhance the institutional performance of participating urban local governments to develop and sustain urban infrastructure, services, and local economic development. The proposed Urban Institutional and Infrastructure Development Program (UIIDP or Operation) will support the objectives of the WB’s Ethiopia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) (2018–22). The CPF for Ethiopia, discussed by the Board on June 27, 2017, has three strategic focus areas: (a) promoting structural and economic transformation through increased productivity, (b) building resilience and inclusiveness, and (c) supporting institutional accountability and confronting corruption. The proposed UIIDP supports all three focus areas. The UIIDP’s fundamental objectives and funding directly target the strengthening of urban governance and management systems, participatory strategic and spatial planning, improved transparency and accountability enhanced citizen engagement in decision-making of urban governments (including of women), public private dialogue, and directly financing urban infrastructure and services. By assisting to create well-functioning and productive urban centers, the UIIDP contributes to the WB’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.The proposed Operation will be financed through a hybrid of Investment Project Financing (IPF) and Program-for-Results (PforR) instruments. Most of the Operation is financed through the PforR instrument, which has proven to be the optimal and effective mechanism for providing conditional grants to regional states and ULGs, as demonstrated in the ULGDP II. There are four primary reasons for this. First, the UIIDP directly supports the government program and forms a core part of the existing intergovernmental fiscal architecture. Second, the basic goal of the UIIDP is to leverage the improved institutional performance of the local governments it supports to more effectively deliver infrastructure and service delivery, and ensure meeting of broader objectives and maximizing of development impact. Due to the direct relationship between the institutional results and the Program disbursements, the PforR instrument allows for a directly incentive-driven approach to achieve the Program Development Objective (PDO). Through the use of disbursement linked indicators (DLIs), the UIIDP will ensure that incentives of the regional and local levels of government are effectively aligned around the goals of the Program. Third, the Program will use, improve, and integrate GoE and local government systems, including public FM, social and environmental systems management and procurement systems. Fourth, the PforR instrument has proven as an effective and efficient tool in the implementation of the ULGDP II and this modality is critical to the success of the program. The government’s new UIIDP (2018–23) envisions that all cities will gradually generate increasing levels of municipal own-source revenues, with which to finance investments in infrastructure and deliver services.

This program document seeks approval of the Executive Directors of a proposed programmatic Economic Management Support Development Policy Financing Operation (EMSO1) to Mongolia. This operation, in the amount of US$120 million, including US$80 million from the IDA 18 Crisis Response Window, is the first of three Development Policy Financing (DPF) operations in a programmatic series. The program development objective of the DPF is to support the Government of Mongolia in restoring debt sustainability, strengthening the social protection system, and enhancing competitiveness. The economic boom in 2011‐13, fueled by strong mineral exports and foreign direct investment (FDI), and expansionary fiscal policy, left Mongolia highly vulnerable to external shocks. These risks materialized from 2014 onward. With minerals accounting for almost 90 percent of exports, a sharp drop in commodity prices and slower growth in China significantly weakened the external and fiscal positions. The economy also took a major hit from a collapse of foreign investment which had reached over 30 percent of GDP during boom years. Expansionary policies compounded these shocks. Economic policy turned expansionary during the double‐digit growth period despite high inflation and a sharp widening of the current account deficit. Economic policy was loosened further from 2014 in response to the external shocks through fiscal expansion and monetary easing, driven by off‐budget expenditure and quasi‐fiscal lending. The economic stimulus, however, came at the cost of a significant increase in economic vulnerabilities. Government debt has increased almost fourfold since 2011, with the budget deficit reaching 17 percent of GDP in 2016. Mounting pressure on the balance of payments caused a sharp currency depreciation and a significant loss of reserves since 2013. Substantial risks to the balance of payments remain as about US$660 million sovereign bonds mature in 2018. The DPF, along with operations from other development partners, supports a set of reform measures to stabilize Mongolia’s economy and move it towards a sustainable development path. The reform programs supported by the DPF, developed in close collaboration with the IMF and ADB, seek to: (i) restore debt sustainability; (ii) strengthening the social protection system; and (iii) enhancing competitiveness. The DPF will also help Mongolia mitigate the immediate balance of payments risks by catalyzing successful market‐based refinancing of maturing commercial debt, and create fiscal space by substituting high‐cost, short‐term domestic borrowing with relatively more concessional and long maturity external assistance.",-0.47262928

P163284,2018,0.1,0.0,0.1,"Cote d'Ivoire - Second Fiscal Management, Education, Energy and Cocoa Reforms Development Policy Operation  The Program Development Objectives (PDOs) are intended to support the Government's ability to: (i) enhance tax revenue and public procurement; (ii) strengthen efficiency and equity in the education sector ; (iii) improve the performance of the electricity sector and enable private participation, and (iv) strengthen institutional framework and the governance of the cocoa sector. There aims mutually reinforcing complementarities within the three pillars since the creation of additional fiscal space through higher revenue mobilization will help increase financing of education expenditure. Similarly, improved access to electricity will boost private sector activities and help collect additional revenue. The operation is the second in a programmatic series of three Development Policy Financing (DPF) operations. The policy program supported by the DPF series aims at: (i) enhancing tax revenue collection and public procurement; (ii) strengthening the efficiency and equity in the education sector; (iii) improving the performance of the electricity sector by enabling private participation and diversification; and (iv) consolidating transparency in the management of the cocoa sector. The DPF series is closely aligned with the 2016-2020 National Development Plan (NDP) and is an integral element of the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Framework (CPF) (FY2016-2019). The second adjustment is the addition of a third and last operation in the series, to broaden its scope and ensure that all reforms are sustainably implemented over time. The initial timeframe of two operations has proved to be too short given the scope and magnitude of all the reforms embedded in the DPF series, especially with the introduction of the fourth pillar proposed above. By adding one more operation, new reforms have been included to assist further the authorities in their effort to implement key policy actions in mobilizing domestic resources (such as the reduction of tax exemptions), in increasing the efficiency and the quality of the education sector (by increasing the teaching time toward targeted poor performing students), and in restoring the financial viability of the energy sector (by ensuring the payment of all arrears). Such extension also contributes to enhance the probability of achieving expected results by consolidating the reforms in strategic sectors such as energy and cocoa, that may face some resistance from vested interests. Lastly, the incorporation of a third operation to the existing series does not represent a radical shift in the WBG strategy since an annual DPF was already programmed during the full period of the CPF (FY2016-2019). The DPF series aims at supporting the Government in its overall effort to promote sustainable and inclusive growth as well as to increase the economy’s resilience to both domestic and external shocks over the next few years. The Government’s strategy has been defined in the recently adopted NDP for the period 2016-2020, which was presented to the international community at the Consultative Group meeting organized in Paris in May 2016. The proposed series selectively focuses on a sub-set of critical challenges linked to fiscal policy and key sectors for inclusive growth: education, energy, and cocoa. These sectors play a critical role in the Government’s strategy as they have all a significant impact on the life of the poorest segments of the population as well as on the redistribution of income across groups. This selectivity was based on the combination of the Government’s priorities, the recent findings of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and other analytical work, and the lessons derived from previous DPF operations in Côte d’Ivoire and in other low-income countries.",-0.45376924

Fiscal sustainability remains a central priority for the government in the context of additional spending needs related to the implementation of the peace agreement and migration-related expenditure. Reducing the vulnerability to terms of trade fluctuations requires further reforms to enable diversification and productivity growth in non-extractive sectors. The operation contributes to the peace and post-conflict agenda and is well-aligned with the objectives of the World Bank Group’s Colombia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY2016-2021.A new National Development Plan (NDP) “Pacto por Colombia – Pacto por la Equidad” covering the period 2018-2022 is currently under discussion in Congress. The new NDP builds on the previous NDP that covered the period 2014–2018. It recognizes the importance of complementing growth with social inclusion to promote shared prosperity. Moreover, the new NDP places its three pillars within a consistent macroeconomic framework, anchored around fiscal responsibility. The new NDP recognizes that productivity and entrepreneurship contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive growth. With its reforms to integrate and include migrants, including refugees, Colombia is proving a regional leader in the proactive management of the Venezuela migration crisis. The Fiscal Sustainability, Competitiveness, and Migration DPF series aims to support Colombia’s efforts to maintain fiscal sustainability measures and improved contingent liabilities management, foster productivity and growth in non-extractive sectors by strengthening the policy framework for trade facilitation, business regulation, innovation and green growth and support regularization and integration of migrants, in the context of the ongoing peace process and under a less favorable external environment.",-0.45195046

This operation draws on the GoI’s recent Coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency response for MSMEs, the RBI’s various liquidity initiatives to shore up MSMEs and financial sector financing, and recommendations from the RBI MSME Committee Report of 2019. The DPF also considers experiences of various credit guarantee schemes (CGS) which have been leveraged across the globe to mobilize financing options for MSMEs during a downward economic cycle when risk aversion heightens, and financial institutions scale back credit to private sector. The DPF also considers experiences from the previous crises episodes which suggest that, to reduce misallocation of public resources during the crisis, the response programs should focus on supporting firms and financial intermediaries which have had long-term viable business models prior to the crisis. Other relevant measures taken by the government and its agencies recently to deal with the adverse impact of the Coronavirus(COVID-19) crisis are also taken into account.

The proposed First Equitable Growth and Job Creation Development Policy Financing is designed to help Jordan lay the foundations for a higher and more sustainable economic growth path, while creating more jobs for Jordanians and non‐Jordanians. The post‐2011 refugee influx has deepened Jordan’s labor abundance, but it did not alter the structural pattern of job creation Currently, job growth is concentrated in low productivity sectors with localized markets and limited attractiveness to efficiency‐seeking investment. Going forward, Jordan is seeking to build resilience into its economy by raising productivity, expanding domestic markets through improved access to finance and stronger institutions for managing risk, and opening new external markets. Jordan's previously successful formula for coping with geopolitical challenges has run into new trends of lower grants, remittances, and investment flows. While the new government will have the benefit of a fresh start on building consensus for reforms, it faces heightened uncertainty over the summer, necessitating accelerated international support. Although Jordan’s adaptability in hosting refugees is intrinsic to its history, the economic context for the latest influx has posed particular challenges. Recent poverty data are not available, but earlier declines in poverty are likely to have halted or even reversed for Jordanians. Jordan's response to the country’s productivity, jobs, and conflict spillover challenges is to seek international support for the fiscal costs of the spillovers, while using that support to catalyze reforms capable of generating productive jobs in a labor‐abundant economy. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is putting together a five‐year priority reform program for equitable growth and job creation whose objective is to set the foundations for higher growth. The program responds to the challenges of prioritizing and implementing reforms that Jordan has included in its strategic documents in the past. Jordan's Vision 2025 was developed in 2014 and has been under implementation since then. The Vision promotes a balanced approach to development and sets out goals for improving social outcomes, the business environment and the functions of government. The Vision incudes about 400 initiatives, with specific actions for each area defined.

The objective of the Transforming Secondary Education for Results Operation Project for Bangladesh is to improve student outcomes in secondary education and the effectiveness of the secondary education system. Bangladesh is one of the world’s most populous countries with an estimated 160 million people living in a geographical area of about 144,415 km2. With a per capita income of US$1,409 in 2016, it is well above the lower-middle-income country category threshold which it crossed in FY14. During recent years, economic conditions improved in the country with headline inflation declining to 5.9 percent in FY16 from 7.3 percent in FY14, while the fiscal deficit was contained at around 3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY16. The FY17 budget targets 5 percent deficit with 28.7 percent growth in expenditures. The current account surplus rose to 1.7 percent of GDP in FY16. The GDP grew well above the average for developing countries in recent years, averaging 6.5 percent since 2010, with an officially reported growth of 7.1 percent in in FY16, driven by manufacturing and services. As Bangladesh aspires to move up the value chain and become an MIC, there must be significant gains in quality and relevance of skills imparted by the secondary education system (both for higher level of education and better jobs in an expanding workforce). Each year, 1.3 million youth join the labor market, but in the face of what is required for the country to reach MIC status, the current composition of the labor force is inadequate. It is undereducated, less than 25 percent of the 57 million workers in the domestic labor market have secondary education, and 89 percent of workers are in the informal market. To foster skills-led economic growth via diversification of economic activities, increasing the pool of medium- to high-skilled workforce is critical. In the rapidly changing economy, the challenge is to move up the value chain in areas of compliance, quality, and reliability, all of which are important for attracting foreign investment. Investing in quality secondary education is key to successfully unleashing the true potential of Bangladesh’s young people and benefiting from the current demographic dividend. Secondary education is recognized in the Seventh Five-year Plan as a critical education cycle to equip youths with foundational skills and noncognitive, socioemotional skills that will enhance productivity at work and accelerate adoption of improved technologies. Improved secondary education increases access to higher-level skills for youths through further skills training and higher education. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) is planning to invest significantly in the secondary education sector, as outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP 2010), in the Seventh Five-year Plan (2016-2020 Accelerating Growth Empowering Citizens) and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

The previous programmatic series was interrupted due to a breach of the International Development Association (IDA) Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP).1 STP has addressed this problem by changing the terms of the loan it contracted with Angola to comply with the NCBP. The previous series, however, could not be resumed since more than 24 months had elapsed after Board approval of the last operation. A stand-alone development policy operation (DPO) was attempted in 2015, but a potential debt arising from a Memorandum of Understanding signed with a Chinese company prevented the World Bank from going forward. This issue has also been satisfactorily resolved. During this period, the country also signed a revised Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 2015, which anchors the short-term fiscal consolidation efforts and includes structural benchmarks on financial stability and measures to address the fiscal imbalance coming from the energy sector. The objective of this operation is to help the Government introduce growth-enabling reforms in the financial sector, business environment, and infrastructure; generate fiscal resources and savings; and improve quality of expenditures. A key focus of government policy is to reduce the dependence on government spending and facilitate the development of alternative growth drivers. This operation will help facilitate this shift by supporting policies that are aimed to address the risks to growth both directly and indirectly. The first pillar of the operation focuses on policies aimed to deal with direct risks to growth such as inadequate frameworks for credit operations and unreliable energy supply. The second pillar brings together policies that will indirectly help mitigate risks to growth. For example, by supporting better SOE surveillance, it is expected that the management of the energy company will improve and thus reduce energy cost and increase reliability of supply.",-0.323418

(2) Improve coverage and quality of social services and strengthen monitoring of outcomes Board Schedule Comments The second Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation (DPO2) in Georgia will support the government in its efforts to improve public service delivery and strengthen fiscal oversight. The first generation reforms, which started a decade back, have helped Georgia improve its business environment, achieve sustained growth rates and maintain low inflation. However, important socioeconomic vulnerabilities persist, including as a result of recent external shocks, under which growth performance and the macro-fiscal stance have deteriorated. Against this backdrop, further improvements in the living standards of Georgians will require investments in human capital, enhanced private sector competitiveness, and fiscal, social and environmental sustainability. Some of these objectives will be supported by this operation through reforms in fiscal management and the delivery of social services. The policy actions are anchored in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2014-17, and are consistent with the government’s own development strategy. The main development challenge faced by the country is achieving more inclusive growth, which will be supported by strengthened fiscal management and improved public service delivery. Achieving inclusive growth will require investment in human capital, and providing a solid and stable macro-fiscal framework that supports private sector activity and competitiveness. Strengthened public service delivery will help build human capital while macro-fiscal stability will make Georgia more attractive for private sector activity. Reform efforts supported by this operation have been grouped in two pillars. Pillar one supports greater fiscal oversight of public institutions (particularly, state-owned enterprises), and improvements in budgeting and the framework for civil services. Pillar two supports improvements in the coverage and quality of social services, and monitoring of outcomes. Reforms supported by this operation will help both in inclusion and inclusive growth. While private sector development, which is being supported by another DPO series in Georgia, will help create more jobs, this DPO series will help build human capital and support macroeconomic stability and effective policy making.",-0.42741156

The debt has grown rapidly principally due to high fiscal deficits (which have grown from 2.6 percent of GDP at the start of the economic crisis to around 6.7 percent of GDP in 2014) but also due to high state support to public utilities and SOEs. There is an urgent need to put public finances on a sustainable footing via, among others, tackling the structural issues - in particular reducing the ineffective direct state subsidies and guarantees - that have often been called -- for public utilities operating in energy (EPS), roads and railways. A sustainable reduction of the subsidies and state guarantees to these SOEs in turn requires reforms to make them financially viable and operationally effective.The government recognizes the need to tackle these structural issues. Fiscal consolidation and improved expenditure management are at the core of both the Fiscal Strategy and the National Economic Reform Program, which include the stabilization of the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of 2017, the completion of privatization and a stop to the issuance of guarantees for liquidity purposes to the remaining SOEs. The WBG will support the government with the achievement of sustainable fiscal consolidation and expenditure management, through the proposed policy-based lending, which will be firmly anchored in the ongoing Public Finance Review (PFR) for Serbia.  The PFR is to be completed by June 2015. The PFR provides a comprehensive and thorough diagnostic of the public finance issues in Serbia, including structural reform opportunities that can anchor medium to long-term debt sustainability in Serbia. This program document presents a Public Expenditure and Public Utilities Development Policy Loan (DPL),  the first in a programmatic series of two operations,, to support the Government of Serbia's multi-year fiscal consolidation agenda and transformation of energy and transport sector public enterprises and state-owned companies.

The DPF instrument will support the implementation of a common set of policies and reforms that the ECOWAS countries have determined as key for cementing the pillars of sustainable electricity trade, contained in ECOWAS Directive C-DIR-2-12-18 on the Securitization of Cross-Border Power Trade Under the Regional Electricity Market (Directive). The Directive was adopted in December 2018 and became effective in January 2020. Increased trade will achieve three objectives: (i) it increases supply options for a utility and therefore increases supply resilience; (ii) it will enable regional indigenous resources to displace fossil fuel imports and will thus reduce the vulnerability of economies to international oil and gas price fluctuations; and (iii) result in cost reductions which reduces the burden of the sector on the fiscal accounts. While this program was not developed in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, maintaining secure strategic electricity supplies is fundamental at this time for healthcare, communication and education services.

The Government plans to use the EMDPL1 with the Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) as a contingency line of financing to address repercussions from increased regional volatility and weaker global growth. Since 2004, Paraguay has been characterized by solid economic growth supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and leveraging of the country’s natural wealth. Economic growth has been above the regional average, inflation is under control and public debt is low. Foreign reserves have remained at prudent levels. The financial sector is sound, with well-capitalized banks with low non-performing loans. Growth has been based on extensive leveraging of the country’s natural resources, particularly land and hydroelectric potential, and on an expanding service sector.

Growth and poverty reduction have been sluggish in Senegal over the past 25 years, but more recently growth accelerated and poverty reduction may be following. Real GDP per capita has only increased by 17 percent in Senegal since 1990, against 45 percent on average in SSA and 134 percent in emerging and developing countries. In addition, growth has been driven by capital accumulation, with little or negative contribution from Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth and human capital accumulation. In the last few years, growth performance improved reaching 6.5 percent in 2015 and expected to attain similar levels or higher in the next few years. In addition to external and internal factors (such as low commodity prices or positive climate behavior), these advances are linked to the implementation of the Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE), with which Senegal aims to become an emerging country by 2035. For this to happen, growth rates of 7-8 percent would be required, in a context of higher productivity and competitiveness. Similarly, progress in poverty reduction has been mixed. Poverty decreased 7 percentage points over 2000-05, particularly in urban areas, and stagnated until 2011 reaching 47.3 percent. Recent data point to a reduction of 2 percentage points since 2011. Underperformance of the Senegalese economy has been related to enduring structural constraints and persistent infrastructure gaps. Macro-fiscal policies have been supportive to growth and Senegal benefits also from other factors such as its coastal location or its 1500 km of optic fiber network. However, structural constraints undermine the efficiency of investment and sustained growth. For instance, growth in agriculture has been slow and volatile, and productivity gains scarce, despite the high potential of the sector and its important share of jobs. In addition, key non-tradable inputs such as communications and electricity, increase the country’s relative prices. Senegal also scores below average on transport infrastructure, and electricity and telephone infrastructure. Furthermore, the country does not take full advantage of existing infrastructure. This is the case, in particular, of the ICT infrastructure, including the important public optic fiber network.",-0.23656057
