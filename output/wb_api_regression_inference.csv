P088543,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Minas Gerais Partnership for Development The operation would support three pillars - fiscal management, public sector management, and private sector development - in two stages, with the initial disbursement made conditional on progress to date at the time of negotiations, and the second disbursement tied to clearly defined future goals in each area. 

The benefits of the operation can be divided into three levels. At the first level, the operation brings benefits in terms of reinforcing the Fiscal Responsibility Law and Brazil#s system of fiscal federal checks and balances.  As discussed elsewhere in this document, this system has been fundamental to assuring Brazil#s national macroeconomic stability since the Real Plan, and by reinforcing the successful adjustment of Brazil#s second largest state, the operation has considerable significance at the national level.

Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment combined with improved economic performance will lead to poverty reduction both through higher incomes and through increased spending available for direct poverty-reducing spending, such as education, health, and basic local infrastructure. Work at the national level suggests that the elasticity of poverty with respect to economic growth in Brazil is about one, and Minas is unlikely to be a significant exception to this statistical regularity at the level of the country.  Furthermore, there is a 25% headcount ratio of poverty in the state.  This implies that a one percent increase in economic growth is likely to reduce poverty in Minas by about a quarter of a percentage point per year, or one percent every four years.

Third, the improvements in the quality of public management in Minas will bring better service delivery to the poor.  Efforts such as results-based management and performance-based human resource management are key in this regard. The Minas Gerais Partnership for Development Project for Brazil reinforces the Fiscal Responsibility Law and Brazil's system of fiscal federal checks and balances.  Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment combined with improved economic performance will lead to poverty reduction both through higher incomes and through increased spending available for direct poverty-reducing spending. Third, improving the quality of public management in Minas will bring better service delivery to the poor. The proposed operation would be a two-tranche development policy loan, with the first tranche to be disbursed upon effectiveness and the second tranche on completion of preset conditions described in the loan agreement.

The objective of the Health Reform Program-for-Results Project for China is to improve the quality of healthcare services and the efficiency of the healthcare delivery systems in Anhui and Fujian provinces. China has made impressive gains in improving overall health outcomes in past decades, along with its rapid economic development. In 2009, China unveiled an ambitious national health care reform program with the goal of providing affordable, equitable and effective health care for all by 2020. The government defined comprehensive reforms in five priority areas: basic health insurance, health service delivery at grassroots level, essential public health service, an essential drugs program, and public hospital reform. After seven years of implementation, China has achieved near universal health insurance (HI) coverage at a speed that has few precedents globally or historically. Health insurance historically mainly covered inpatient services, and hospitals were paid by insurance through a fee for service system. Service providers therefore were incentivized to produce more, often unnecessary services, driving up investment and recurrent cost, and sometimes endangering human life. China now has more hospital beds per capita than the USA, Canada or the UK, and hospital services account for 54 percent of China’s total health expenditure compared to less than 10 percent for primary care. Average lengths of hospital stays, a key driver of costs, is high in China relative to OECD countries (9.8 days compared to 7.3 days). As a result, total spending on health increased fourteen-fold in the last two decades from about 220 billion yuan to 3,170 billion yuan in real terms, raising affordability and sustainability concerns. At the same time, human resource shortages and poor capacity at the grassroots have weakened the delivery of primary healthcare services. China faces a massive shortage of general practitioners (GPs) and nurses, and the primary health care (PHC) workforce declined from 40 percent of total workforce in 2009 to 36 percent in 2013. Integration of health services across provider tiers (e.g., tertiary, secondary and primary) and between preventive and curative services is weak. Providers at different levels have an incentive to compete with each other in order to maximize their revenues, rather than managing population health in a coordinated and cost-effective manner. Weak primary care systems, poor provider integration and a lack of gate keeping and screening systems have contributed to premature mortality due to NCDs in China being almost double that of Japan. Finally, insufficient coordination among institutional actors is a major impediment to innovation and sustained reform implementation in the health sector. There are over ten government agencies involved in the decision-making and administration of the health sector, all the way down to the provincial and local levels, which constrains coordinated and coherent policy formulation and implementation.",0.06798062

More specifically, the RRSPIV focuses on: (i) improving the capacity for and transparency of public procurement; (ii) improving internal control procedures and the capacity for internal audit; (iii) improving revenue administration and (iv) improving land administration to reduce conflicts and enhance the investment climate. The objective of the Fourth Re-engagement and Reform Support Program for Liberia is to support government-owned ongoing reforms to strengthen governance and improve the environment for private sector-led, inclusive growth. Poor governance and nearly fifteen years of brutal conflict destroyed lives, key institutions, infrastructure, and grounded the Liberian economy to a halt. Schools and hospitals were damaged or destroyed and key social services were severely disrupted. Major infrastructure including roads, railroads, electricity generation and transmission, potable water and sewage facilities were utterly destroyed. The origin of the conflict is largely blamed on the exclusion and marginalization of a large part of the Liberia population from political power and the economic wealth from the country's natural resources. Poor economic governance and weak public financial management in particular allowed public resources to be utilized for the benefit a small group of political elite which heightened inequality and social instability. The country is now at an inflection point, moving from the transitional post-conflict recovery phase to laying the foundations for long-term development. The government's main focus is on: (i) strengthening governance moving beyond moving beyond the transitional Governance and Economic Management Assisted Program (GEMAP) which ended at Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in June 2010 to establishing and sustaining institutions and systems to address endemic corruption and secure the rule of law; (ii) promoting and sustaining broad-based economic growth getting major transport corridors functioning to open up trade and commerce, revitalizing agriculture to ensure job creation; (iii) rebuilding infrastructure ensure the delivery of basic services and improve the environment for investment; and (iv) rebuilding capacity in the public service to ensure effective delivery of key social services including health and education. The strong post-conflict recovery continued into 2008 but the global crisis towards the end of 2008 through most of 2009 created substantial challenges for Liberia's fledgling economy.

 The development objective of the Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program Project for Nepal is to provide safe, reliable and cost effective bridges on Nepal's strategic roads network (SRN). Nepal is still emerging from a 10-year armed conflict that ended in 2006 and is currently passing through a momentous and prolonged political transition which is still in a fragile and incomplete state. This transition entails two interrelated processes: promulgation of a new constitution and the completion of the ongoing peace process. The Constitution is expected to lead to a major restructuring of Nepal into a federal state while the completion of the peace process is expected to resolve the integration/rehabilitation of former Maoist combatants. Nepal's peace process is progressing with the closure of Maoist cantonments and political parties attempting to resolve all contentious outstanding constitutional issues. These issues include state restructuring, forms of governance, electoral system, constitutional court, and citizenship questions to be enshrined in the new constitution. Nepal's economic growth has been adversely affected by the political uncertainty. Growth over the past decade has been below potential, relying largely on remittances and tourism. Nonetheless, Nepal has made good progress both in terms of poverty reduction and improvement of social indicators.

The PESF represents an opportunity to provide enhanced support to an important client with a sustained record of prudent macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline at a time of increased stresses in global financial markets. The government has clearly indicated that it feels that the Bank's engagement on the policy dialogue is critical, both in terms of the substantive support provided as well as in terms of the signal it sends to the market and to Indonesia's bilateral and multilateral partners.

The review suggests that overall progress with development support credit (DSC II) triggers has been positive. The macroeconomic framework is on track, banking and state own enterprise (SOE) reforms have proceeded with some minor variations and broad governance reforms have moved ahead. In the energy sector several structural reforms have moved ahead, although progress on the privatization front has been inadequate. The other area where there has been significant shortfall is regarding implementation of energy price agreements under DSC I. This is largely due to unanticipated surge in world oil prices and the Government considers a full pass through of these increases to consumers as politically impossible. It has nevertheless made some minimum adjustments in gas, kerosene and petrol prices and has also reduced the taxes on petroleum products. While all energy product prices excluding domestic taxes exceed international prices, including tax (weighted average rate of about 30%) the domestic prices fall short for kerosene and diesel. Since these products account for some 75% of total oil consumption, the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation is incurring losses. The resultant adverse impact o f higher petroleum costs on BPC's finances has been offset by the lower central Government deficit. Importantly, the Government has taken new measures relating to tax revenues and trade tariff reductions in the FY05 budget that strengthen the overall reform program and demonstrate the Government's resolve to stay the course on reforms.",0.15263589

P120946,0.0,0.0,0.0,"VN-Public Investment Reform 2 Though Vietnam's economy has grown rapidly, the bulk of this growth has come through factor accumulation, with modest contribution from productivity growth. The country therefore cannot achieve its objective of growing at 7 to 8 percent, as indicated in its Socio-economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, without raising the productivity of investment, especially public investment. The reforms supported by PIR 2 attempt to improve the effectiveness of public investment through better project selection, implementation, financial management and oversight.
In doing so, PIR 2 supports one of the emerging priorities of the SEDS 2011-2020, namely to raise productivity of investment.  The operation also supports modern governance, which is one of the four main pillars of Vietnam's Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010.  The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is aligned to the SEDP.  Better planning processes, more transparent procurement and stronger public financial management, all areas covered by the proposed program, fall under the modern governance pillar of SEDP.
Through its focus on the environmental screening and the environmental management of projects, the proposed program is also expected to contribute to the natural resources pillar of SEDP. Its attention to fair compensation and livelihood support in the event of land acquisition should also contribute to the social inclusion pillar. The objective of the Second Public Investment Reform Operation Program for Vietnam is to support one of the emerging priorities of the Socio-economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, namely to raise productivity of investment. Improving the efficiency of investment has emerged as one of the key economic priorities in Vietnam. The country has already achieved rapid economic growth and fast poverty reduction over the last twenty years. However, there is a growing concern that the momentum of a growth strategy that is largely based on factor accumulation may have run its course. Vietnam has one of the highest investments to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratios in the world, averaging around 43 percent of GDP during the past five years. But the growth rate has not been commensurate with this high investment rate. The inefficiencies in public investment are partly the result of inherited institutional constraints. During the command and control period, public sector investments used to be managed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). MPI used to compile proposals from line ministries, provincial governments and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and arbitrate among competing demands. The weaknesses of the public investment cycle have also resulted in cost overruns, time delays and slow disbursement of development assistance. There are important gaps between Vietnam's national system and international practices in areas such as environmental screening and environmental management, project preparation and appraisal, procurement, public financial management, the regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure, and monitoring and evaluation. The program is designed to assist the government of Vietnam (GoV) to strengthen the selection, preparation, implementation and supervision of public investment projects. While much progress has been made over the last decade in the upgrading of public financial management in relation to recurrent expenditures, there are still important weaknesses in the management of investment projects. The program supports a series of policy measures which are expected to strengthen the effectiveness of public investment in Vietnam.

Macroeconomic uncertainty due to fiscal and financial sector vulnerabilities including elevated public debt levels has been a constraint to sustain high and inclusive growth in Montenegro. In 2020-21, the country is facing high rollover risks in the external bond market which warrant a sound debt reduction and management strategy. At the same time, Montenegro faces rising global uncertainties, including a slowdown in global and EU growth, which reinforces the need for prudent macroeconomic management to mitigate the risks for its small euroized economy. This operation supports the authorities in their efforts to increase the efficiency of public finances and maintain a well-capitalized and supervised banking sector to strengthen fiscal and financial sector resilience, a prerequisite to sustain strong and inclusive economic growth in Montenegro. The macroeconomic risk is high given the increasingly uncertain and volatile external economic environment and the upcoming refinancing needs. Risk related to stakeholders is considered substantial given the ambitious nature of the supported reform program. Political and governance risk is also substantial and is related to the general elections which are planned to take place by October 2020.

This document presents a Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the amount of US$200 million for the Republic of Panama, the final in a programmatic series of three. Economic growth and public transfers brought about an important reduction in poverty, which has almost halved over the decade. Strong economic growth in Panama has been pro-poor and contributed to prosperity being more widely shared. Panama's economic growth has been one of the fastest in Latin America over the past decade, a trend that has even accelerated in recent years. The country has done well in integrating into the global economy and has leveraged its geographical position, transforming itself into a well-connected logistics hub. Yet inequality remains in the mid-range for Latin American countries and challenges persist in the public provision of social services. The strong growth performance during 2011-2012 has started to moderate; yet it remains at high levels. After the 2009 economic crisis, economic growth in Panama has exceeded the pre-crisis pace, with growth rates of over 10 percent in 2011 and 2012. The overall preparation risk is rated as moderate. All prior actions have been completed and proven with evidence.

The Program Development Objective of the  Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation ( SBMSO) is to:  to reduce open defecation in rural areas, and strengthen MDWS capacity to manage the national SBM-G program. India has been one of the fastest growing economies during the last decade. Between 2004 and 2011, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a rate of 8.3 percent per year while poverty declined by an average of 2.5 percentage points per year, a pace significantly faster than earlier periods. Poverty reduction was supported by higher economic growth and greater responsiveness of poverty to growth, including through the expansion of social programs. Increases in non-farm wage employment, especially in construction, greater rural-urban integration, and higher rural wage growth were amongst the key drivers. However, in the more recent period since 2012, a slowdown in rural real wage growth and volatility in construction activity may have had a sobering effect on the pace of poverty reduction. At the same time, acceleration of growth to 7.3 percent in 2015, if sustained, may lead to further gains for the poor. Maintaining the growth momentum, and increasing the responsiveness of poverty reduction to growth, is an India’s key challenge going forward. The overall experience of the past national sanitation programs offer several lessons. First, eliminating OD will not be achieved through a top-down approach of constructing toilets. Instead, it needs to be driven by changing behavior at the community level. This requires complementary ‘soft’ interventions such as interpersonal communication of hygiene messages. Second, the implementation of SBM-G is being conducted by the states, and therefore the role of MDWS is to support states with allocation of funds and incentives for achievement of programs goals and objectives. This role is proposed to be expanded to provide additional capacity building and technical support to the implementing institutions in the states. Third, by recognizing and incentivizing good performance of states and their implementing agencies, especially GPs, fiscal programs should intelligently provide incentives to those implementing the program and who are key facilitators in achieving and sustaining the success of SBM-G. In order to implement an operation of national scale, a hybrid operation is proposed using two lending instruments: (a) Program for Results (PforR), for results orientation and supporting the incentive component of the national program; and (b) Investment Project Financing (IPF), for program management and capacity building at the national level.",0.100192465

The proposed First Equitable Growth and Job Creation Development Policy Financing is designed to help Jordan lay the foundations for a higher and more sustainable economic growth path, while creating more jobs for Jordanians and non‐Jordanians. The post‐2011 refugee influx has deepened Jordan’s labor abundance, but it did not alter the structural pattern of job creation Currently, job growth is concentrated in low productivity sectors with localized markets and limited attractiveness to efficiency‐seeking investment. Going forward, Jordan is seeking to build resilience into its economy by raising productivity, expanding domestic markets through improved access to finance and stronger institutions for managing risk, and opening new external markets. Jordan's previously successful formula for coping with geopolitical challenges has run into new trends of lower grants, remittances, and investment flows. While the new government will have the benefit of a fresh start on building consensus for reforms, it faces heightened uncertainty over the summer, necessitating accelerated international support. Although Jordan’s adaptability in hosting refugees is intrinsic to its history, the economic context for the latest influx has posed particular challenges. Recent poverty data are not available, but earlier declines in poverty are likely to have halted or even reversed for Jordanians. Jordan's response to the country’s productivity, jobs, and conflict spillover challenges is to seek international support for the fiscal costs of the spillovers, while using that support to catalyze reforms capable of generating productive jobs in a labor‐abundant economy. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is putting together a five‐year priority reform program for equitable growth and job creation whose objective is to set the foundations for higher growth. The program responds to the challenges of prioritizing and implementing reforms that Jordan has included in its strategic documents in the past. Jordan's Vision 2025 was developed in 2014 and has been under implementation since then. The Vision promotes a balanced approach to development and sets out goals for improving social outcomes, the business environment and the functions of government. The Vision incudes about 400 initiatives, with specific actions for each area defined. In 2017, Jordan developed the Jordan Economic Growth Plan (JEGP) 2018‐2022.The first pillar of the programmatic DPF series will support a better operating environment for the private sector in terms of costs, regulatory complexity, and predictability. The second pillar will support increased economic opportunities and flexibility in the labor market and expansion of the safety net. The third pillar of the programmatic DPF series will support the Government’s fiscal consolidation efforts by focusing on efficiency in public investment, ensuring maximum opportunities for private investment in traditional public investment areas through the adoption of a Maximizing Finance for Development approach, and updating the approach to managing debt and contingent liabilities. The pillars supported by this DPF series reinforce each other as part of a comprehensive approach to tackle the nexus of a complex legal and regulatory framework, discretionary implementation, lack of access to formal sector markets, and a narrow tax base due to widespread informality.",0.07922357

Armenia was among the worst affected by the global crisis, notwithstanding its strong pre-crisis performance on growth and poverty reduction. As exports, remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI) fell, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by more than 14 percent in 2009 due mainly to a precipitous decline in the booming construction sector. Nearly 40 percent of households suffered from losses of wages, farm income and remittances; incidence of poverty rose from 23.5 to 26.5 percent of the population after more than a decade of continuing decline.

Romania has made considerable economic progress over the past two decades, but it needs more sustainable and inclusive growth. Over the past decades, Romania has achieved impressive economic progress, transitioning to a market-based economic model, and acceding to the European Union (EU) in 2007 and reaching high income status. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity (ppp) more than doubled from US12,177 dollars in 2000 to US32,496 dollars in 2022 and income convergence with the EU accelerated. From 2015 to 2020, the share of Romanians living below the upper-middle-income poverty line (i.e., on less than US6.85 dollars a day in 2017 ppp) declined rapidly from 27.8 to 10.7 percent. However, economic prosperity has been unevenly distributed, with widening regional disparities in income and service delivery, and poverty and inequality rates that are consistently among the highest in the EU. Going forward, inclusive growth objectives will need to be reconciled with equally ambitious climate commitments. The program supported by this DPL builds on the focus areas of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) Update, recommendations from the Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR), Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD) and other analytics like the forthcoming Public Finance Review (PFR). It also links to complementary technical assistance (TA) through trust funded, Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) and upstream advisory engagements, including joint IBRD-IFC work on creating a more favorable policy and regulatory environment for private capital and investment, which continue to support the program’s implementation. The DPL is aligned with the CPF, with considerations for the linkages and cross-sectoral nature of issues in an advanced economy with a rapidly aging population, being at the global frontier of climate action, with corresponding potential for knowledge spillovers, particularly on partnering with the EU and private sector.",0.27795565

 The objective of the Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program Project (RWSS) for India is to improve the performance of Maharashtra's sector institutions in planning, implementation and monitoring of its Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program and to improve access to quality and sustainable services in peri-urban villages, and in water-stressed and water quality-affected areas. India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the last decade, but its economy now shows signs of slowing down. Between 2004 and 2011, a period that includes the global financial crisis, India's growth averaged 8.3 percent per year. Expanding social programs lowered the poverty rate by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2004-09, double the rate of the preceding decade. India's growth rate however slipped to a decade low of 5 percent in 2012-13 due to a combination of domestic and external factors, including high inflation, high fiscal deficit and weak external demand for the country's exports. This slowdown carries high social costs for millions of Indians, and threatens the gains made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Under its current 10-year RWSS program, Government of Maharashtra (GoM) seeks to significantly expand the frontiers in the sector with a focus on increasing house connection coverage, ensuring continuous water supply with adequate pressure and minimum quality standards, and ensuring that 100 percent of the rural population has access to safe water and basic sanitation. However, delivering this vision requires building capacities of institutions through appropriate implementation and management models. Maharashtra is also a rapidly urbanizing state with many large villages (each with a population of more than 10,000 people) and a growing number of peri-urban areas that are demanding higher levels of service. Finally, the state also faces challenges in addressing the needs of water-stressed and water quality affected areas, managing drinking water quality, and ensuring drinking water security in the face of increasing droughts and climate change impacts on rainfall patterns and the yield of existing sources.",0.14157559

More specifically, the objective of this supplemental credit is to provide the additional polio vaccine required to carry out the intensification of Nigeria's ongoing polio eradication program during 2005 and 2006, needed because of the outbreaks of wild polio especially in but not limited to the North of the country.Key Performance Indicators: The project.s success would be measured by the following key indicators and targets:·   Timely arrival at national level of OPV procured through UNICEF. Target: vaccines arrive at least 5 weeks before the SIA in the national strategic store in Abuja. Tool: UNICEF/NPI vaccine arrival report.·   Coverage of SIA. Target: coverage of OPV is at least 80% in each endemic State.

The Government of Argentina has undertaken a major reform of economic policy aimed at price stability and sustained economic growth. Measures to focus the state on core public functions and raise the efficiency of revenue mobilization have been essential for improving the fiscal fundamentals. Trade liberalization and the deregulation of domestic markets have improved economic efficiency. These reforms have been strongly encouraged and supported by the World Bank. Complementing earlier public sector reforms, the Bank extended two Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loans and a Public Sector Reform Loan (1991-92) along with complementary technical assistance loan (1991). The Government is now in the process of reducing the role of public banks and strengthening private banks. To support these reforms the Bank approved the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) in February 1993. This report proposes a Capital Market Development Technical Assistance (CMTAP) Project that will help provide term finance from private sources. The Capital Market Development Project will support a backstop facility (BF) that will offer prime-rated banks an option to sell to the BF medium-term US dollar-dominated bonds which will be issued for the purpose of rolling over prior dollar-denominated bonds that those banks had issued to support their longer term loan for productive purposes.

The Kecamatan-Based Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project will be built on the existing Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), which was already operating in Nias prior to the tsunami and earthquake and now covers the entire island. KDP consists of a facilitated planning process that lets communities identify their own priorities, which are then funded through a block grant transferred directly to a bank account owned by all of the villages within the kecamatan. Fifty percent of the funding for the proposed project will come through an Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) grant, and the other 50 percent will be provided by the Government of Indonesia from national (APBN) funding. Building on an existing project allows the program to get off to a fast start. To keep the program manageable, it is divided into 4 windows. The first window, the housing window, will be initially confined to the four or five affected kecamatans in each of Nias's two kabupaten, for a total of 9 kecamatans and approximately 84 villages (see Annex l), although some slight adjustment to these numbers is likely to happen during final design allocations.

By replacing the CFC chillers with systems that are 30% more efficient, the CO2 emissions associated with air-conditioning can be reduced by the same amount. The objectives of the Building Chiller Replacement Project for Thailand are to assist Thailand in 1) improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the building chiller sector; and 2) reducing consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODS) required under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.. Specifically, the project establishes preferred conditions that facilitate early replacement of low-energy efficiency chillers using chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerant with high-energy efficiency non-CFC chillers. There are two project components. The first aims to demonstrate actual energy savings realized by high efficiency non-CFC chillers under the climatic conditions of Thailand by replacing approximately 24 CFC chillers and monitoring their performance. The main activities comprise final appraisal of 24 sub-projects and signing of sub-loan agreements with chiller owners; and physical replacement of the 24 chillers. The second component funds an independent evaluation consulting team, which oversees and evaluates the quality of works of all equipment suppliers at the time of dismantling the existing units and installation of new chillers. These consulting services will a) evaluate the success and lessons learned from the pilot project; b) market and promote the development of the follow-on chiller replacement program: and c) design and prepare an implementation plan.",0.49299237

This last operation, however, could face significant implementation risks due to the pandemic COVID-19. Bhutan continues to rely on hydropower as a key driver of growth. However, dependence on the hydropower sector has created macroeconomic vulnerabilities, which are now exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 and contributed to a procyclical fiscal policy stance. In addition, the private sector in Bhutan is still at a nascent stage and creates few quality jobs. Addressing these constraints will require reforms to fiscal policy, public financial management, private sector competitiveness, and investments in human capital. Furthermore, reforms are also needed to make the policy framework environmentally sustainable and inclusive. Some of these objectives will be supported by this operation. The Development Policy Credit (DPC) series is consistent with the FY2015-19 World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY15-19 discussed by the Board on September 23, 2014 and the 2017 Performance and Learning Review (PLR) and supports all the three pillars of the CPS: (i) improving fiscal and spending efficiency; (ii) increasing private sector growth and competitiveness; and (iii) supporting green development. It also supports both the pillars of the proposed new FY2020-24 Country Partnership Framework (CPF): (i) human capital and equity and (ii) resilience.

The development objective of the Local Development Program-for-Results Project for Egypt is to improve the business environment for private sector development and strengthen local government capacity for quality infrastructure and service delivery in select governorates in Upper Egypt. The lack of opportunities for sustainable jobs and growth continue to be significant challenges for the Arab Republic of Egypt. These challenges strongly manifest themselves in Upper Egypt, a grouping of tengovernorates that lag significantly behind the rest of the country in economic growth,employment generation, connectivity, and access to services. Three key constraints, in particular, contribute to weak economic activity in Upper Egypt and relatively low level of private investment: (a) limited empowerment, effectiveness,and accountability of subnational governorates; (b) continuing low levels of access and quality ofinfrastructure and services for both citizens and businesses; and (c) weak investment climate andthe weakness of economic factors supporting value chain development. The first critical constraint to private-sector-led economic growth in Upper Egypt islimited empowerment, accountability, and effectiveness at the governorate and district level. The second constraint is a relatively low level of access and poor quality ofinfrastructure and services for residents as well as firms. The third key constraint to private-sector-led growth in Upper Egypt is the weakinvestment and business climate, with business owners citing obstacles and delays in obtaining licenses, permits, and serviced land.

The objective of the Environmental Management Project is to provide the Republic of Maldives with the capacity to effectively manage environmental risks and threats to fragile coral reefs as well as marine habitats resulting from tourism development, increased solid waste disposal, fisheries and global climate change. There are four components to the project. The first component is the regional solid waste management program. Solid waste is the most visible environmental threat to the tourism and fishery industries. In a recent survey, solid waste was identified as the most important environmental issue by 24 percent of respondents. The management of solid waste is especially challenging in the Maldives, even more so than other small island states. With a population spread across numerous islands, there is little scope for harnessing economies of scale. Thus, the costs of service delivery are high. The second component is the capacity building for environmental management. The project is designed to at least partly fill the staffing gaps and capacity needs as they relate to the Project itself. It is apparent that it would be nearly impossible to build a large, permanent cadre of environmental specialists with a reach extending over the entire archipelago and across all sectors.

Progress made under the program for growth and employment generation supported by PRSC-3 has been broadly satisfactory, with prudent management of fiscal accounts providing scope for debt reduction, while new government programs for the development of the private sector, agriculture and natural resources management provided guidance to the implementation of the GPRS.  Specific actions included the following: 
 
*	Reducing public domestic debt to increase the credit available to the private sector.  Although fiscal developments in 2004, in particular the need to accommodate the increase in oil prices in international markets, meant a slightly higher overall fiscal deficit than planned, faster real GDP growth allowed the targeted reduction in the domestic debt to be met, with the domestic debt to GDP ratio declining to 15 percent by end-2004, down from 19 percent at end-2003.  Lower levels of domestic public debt and declining inflation allowed, in turn, for nominal interest rates treasury bills to ease to an average of 19 percent in 2004, down from 26 percent in 2003.  Increased availability of credit to the private sector followed suit, and is estimated to have increased by 33 percent in 2004, reaching 55 percent of domestic credit, up from 52 percent at end-2003. 
 
*	Diversifying the financial sector, with several actions completed in the implementation of the FINSSIP.  The Long Term Savings Bill was approved by Parliament on October 28, 2004, deepening the savings mobilization for old age and housing.  There were also improvements in the administrative framework for micro-finance, with establishment of an interim committee for the micro-finance center composed of a four member technical committee, which, in consultation with stakeholder beneficiaries, is coordinating the micro-finance services in the country.  Actions are now needed to nominate the members of the Board, so as to formally establish a single entry point for Micro Finance coordination within Government.  Another action related to micro-finance was the publication of a list of all current Government programs in this area, which is being followed up by a census of other interventions being undertaken by private sector and NGOs, making the report more complete.  Finally, the operations of the Central Settlement and Depository System (CSDS) for government securities commenced in November 2004 at the Bank of Ghana, with the set up of the site linkages and the registration of the CSDS as a company.  Still pending, however, is the Parliamentary approval of the CSD Bill, which will provide the necessary legal backing to the operations of the CSDS.  The aim is to record all security transactions in electronic form, increasing the liquidity and reducing the costs of transactions in government securities, especially for small investors. 
 
*	Continuing the implementation of the power sector reform, with additional efforts made in restructuring the energy sector to encourage efficiency and the quality of service delivery.  The automatic mechanism for adjusting energy tariffs remained operational, although no adjustments were required because of the shift in the electricity generation mix toward less expensive hydroelectric sources.Progress was also made in commencing the implementation of a five-year performance-based ECG Management Support Services Agreements (MSSAs), with the issuance of the Request for Proposals (RfP) to the qualified bidders on June 9, 2005, setting a July 19 deadline for receiving technical and financial proposals.  Also, progress was made in continuing the process of transforming the Volta River Authority (VRA) into two separate companies (the distribution and the generations companies), and the establishment of an independent transmission company, with the VRA Amendments act approved by Parliament on July 22, 2004.  In the meantime, VRA?s Assets Revaluation was completed, and consultants were engaged to separate the books of accounts. 
 
*	Removing administrative and regulatory barriers for private sector development, with actions being taken on five fronts.  First, steps have been taken to strengthen the institutional framework to implement the PSD strategy with the PSD oversight committee constituted in November 2004, with authority to coordinate across ministries.  The institutional review was completed and recommendations issued in July 2005.  These will be followed by Oversight Committee consultations and presentation of major recommendations to the Cabinet.  Second, the trade policy was approved by Cabinet in October 2004, formally launched in February 2005, and the work of the Trade Sector Support Program commenced.  Third, the establishment of four land deed registries outside Accra has proceeded as scheduled, with adverts issued for the inauguration of the registries in Sekondi and Sunyani on May 20 and 23, and in Koforidua and Tamale on June 13 and 15.  The new deed registries should allow greater security in land transactions and the increase ability to post deed certificates as loan collaterals.  Fourth, the operations of GCnet have begun at Aflao, with the submission and processing of declarations having started already in September 2004.  The connection at Elubo has been fully prepared but is not operational yet due to technical problems with the connection provided by Ghana Telecom.  Fifth, the automation of Registrar-General?s Department (RGD) has proceeded as scheduled, with the hardware, networking infrastructure and software installation completed. 
 
*	Improving the performance of the rural sector in the interest of the rural poor, with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) continuing to implement the activities programmed under its strategic plan.  The process of revising the Food and Agriculture Sector Development Plan (FASDEP) has continued, with a multi-disciplinary committee identifying the poverty?focused elements recommended in the recently completed Policy and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) on the economic transformation of the agricultural sector.  In aiming at raising the efficiency in the delivery of extension services, the regional research liaison committees are now operational in all the ten regions of the country.  Planning sessions have been completed in all regions.  District planning sessions have also been held in all the Districts to gather demand driven research proposals.  Regional review meetings will examine proposals from prioritized rechargeable problems and approve of proposals for funding by the Competitive Agricultural Research Grant Scheme (CARGS).  In tandem, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, MOFA has commenced the process of recruiting the 250 Agriculture Extension Advisors (AEAs) and 50 agriculture graduates annually over the next five years.  This recruitment aims at helping to raise the Extension Agent-Farmers? ratio from the current level of 1:1400 to 1:1000. Finally, to revitalize the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation process within MOFA, a new policy process is being rolled out.  A presentation of the proposal has been made to staff of MoFA and followed up by orientation courses. Also, the review of MOFA?s Decentralization Program is ongoing, with a draft handbook on roles and responsibilities of MOFA staff positions already prepared.

new risks have emerged. The rapid growth of financial institutions in recent
years has contributed to Moroccos growth performance and expanded the frontiers
of finance. However, itis also apparent that, despite significant
improvements, the financial system is not yet providing services to large
segments of low income households and SMEs. Moreover, this rapid growth has
also generated new risks in the banking, insurance and microcredit sectors that
need to be effectively managed. The global financial crisis added importance to
further reforms.
The Government has launched a four pillar reform program that addresses
effectively the dual objectives of access and stability. The first pillar
contains measures that promote access to individuals while the second pillar
comprises measures to enhance access to small and medium enterprises. The third
pillar strengthens the resiliency of the financial system through further and
important improvements in financial regulation and supervision. The fourth
pillar, capital market development, contributes both to access and stability, by
promoting competition to banks, and introducing better instruments of risk
management.
 Morocco has made substantial progress in developing its financial sector. The total assets of Moroccan financial institutions have grown significantly and exceed 200 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), a ratio that is well above the level predicted by Morocco's per capita income. This progress in financial development has been the result of sound macroeconomic policies and important financial sector reforms earlier in the decade, which positioned Morocco to take advantage of favorable conditions.

It includes four mutually reinforcing pillars which build on major improvements in the soundness and risk management capacity of financial institutions. The first pillar contains measures that promote access to households while the second pillar comprises measures to enhance access to small and medium enterprises. The launch of a credit bureau and revised partial credit guarantee mechanisms will allow further progress in access and improved risk management. The third pillar strengthens the resiliency of the financial system through further improvements in financial regulation and supervision. It will allow an early identification of risks and will avoid a repeat of the difficulties experienced by the microcredit sector. The fourth pillar, capital market development, contributes both to access and stability. It promotes competition to banks which will encourage them to go down market, and will make new information and instruments available therefore making further gains in long term financing.",0.0052060997

These transformativeactions include policy reforms and institutional reforms based on the piloting of innovative practices. 
 This operation is the second in the series of two Development Policy Loans (DPLs) that supports the Government of Himachal Pradesh (GoHP) to make a permanent paradigm shift to promote inclusive green growth and sustainable development. It leverages financing from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) in the amount of US$ 100 million that follows on from DPL 1 which was approved by the Board on September 6, 2012 in the amount of $100 million financed through IBRD. The program of DPL 1 and 2 are designed to help GoHP to develop a framework which, if followed, should ensure that energy generation is greener, the dependence on fossil fuels is lower and the impacts on the environment and people are much reduced. This program will assist GoHP in transformative actions in sectors that are key engines of growth (i.e. energy, industry and tourism). These transformative actions include policy reforms and institutional reforms based on the piloting of innovative practices.

The objective of the credit is to support the Government of Senegal in the implementation of subsector reforms aimed at improving
 the investment climate and accelerating private sector growth an employment.


 The Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) aims to support the Government of Senegal in the implementing subsector reforms to improve the investment climate and accelerate private sector growth and employment. Specifically, it  (i) supports the implementation of a private enterprise tax regime that stimulates investments through leveling the playing field and lowering taxes, and allocates user fees for private sector promotion purposes (ii) restructures the edible oil sector by improving the competitive environment in which it operates, that is, through eliminating or reducing policy distortions associated with non-tariff barriers and other domestic protection mechanisms, and public interventions; (iii) reforming postal services by introducing greater competition, restructuring the postal enterprise so as to enhance its sustainability, and creating an autonomous financial subsidiary that would provide savings, and payment and transfer services; and (iv) changing the pension system to make it financially sustainable and improving its corporate governance. The last two reforms entail substantial financial restructuring, involving clearance of arrears, that would need to be financed by the public budget. In the same vein, the proposed tax reforms may entail revenue shortfalls in the short term. The Credit aims to provide budget resources through counterpart funds generated by balance of payment support it provides, and thus help ensure that social and poverty alleviation programs are not disrupted.  The first tranche of the proposed four-tranche operation would help initiate these reforms. The other three floating tranches would support specific reforms in each of the above areas, except in the edible oil sector, which will be fully covered by the first tranche.  A possible risk includes  imperfect implementation of the reforms, which would undermine their sustainability. Political risk due to opposing vested interests has been offset in a number ways-undertaking diagnostics studies to strengthen the analytical basis of the reforms, following a broad participatory process to ensure stakeholder buy-in; focusing on outcomes through project design simplicity, .The second risk is institutional in nature. To avoid the risk of imperfect implementation due to lack of capacity, insufficient analysis and absence of consensus, the parallel Private Investment Promotion Project (PIPP) assists in designing and  implementing the reforms. The third category of risk is specific to the four areas of reform within the program. One such risk concerns the privatization of the groundnut operator, which is very advanced and is not expected to materialize. Other risks are considered manageable and are mitigated through a combination of upfront actions being taken, implementation support provided by IDA and consensus building in favor of the reforms.",0.018155148

Growth has accelerated in the last two quarters to reach 8.2 percent in the first quarter of FY18-2019. This growth was supported by a revival in industrial activity, strong private consumption, and a rise in exports of goods and services. At the same time, the external situation has become less favorable. The current account balance has widened on the account of an increasing trade deficit (on the back of strong import demand and higher oil prices) from 0.7 percent of GDP in FY16-17 to 1.9 percent in FY17-18. Meanwhile, external headwinds, monetary policy ‘normalization’ in the US coupled with recent stress in some Emerging Market Economies, have triggered portfolio outflows from April 2018 onwards, putting additional pressure on the balance of payments. Going forward, growth is projected to reach 7.3 percent in FY18-19 and to firm up thereafter at around 7.5 percent, primarily on account of robust private and public consumption expenditure, a rise in exports of goods and services, and a gradual increase in investments. However, the current account deficit is also projected to remain elevated in FY18-19. Between FY2011-12 and 2015, poverty declined from 21.6 percent to an estimated 13.4 percent at the international poverty line (2011 PPP US dollar 1.90 per person per day), continuing the earlier trend of robust reduction in poverty. Aided by robust economic growth, more than 90 million people escaped extreme poverty and improved their living standards during this period. Despite this success, poverty remains widespread in India. In 2015, with the latest estimates, 176 million Indians were living in extreme poverty while 659 million, or half the population, were below the higher poverty line commonly used for lower middle-income countries (2011 PPP US$3.20 per person per day). Recent trends in the construction sector and rural wages, a major source of employment for the poorer households, suggest that the pace of poverty eradication may have slowed. India is still marked by disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as structural inequalities by gender, tribe, and caste.

The 1994 conflict left the Rwanda education system infrastructure devastated and the teacher force decimated. The initial focus of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) in the area of basic education has been on increasing access to primary education. These efforts have been largely successful. Over the last decade, gross and net enrollment rates increased from 88 to 128 percent and 70 to 94 percent, respectively, with the share of girls comprising slightly more than half of the primary school level student population. The Government is now turning its focus on both increasing access to basic education and improving the quality of education. The Education for All (EFA)-Fast Track Initiative (FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF) is a multi-donor trust fund that supports countries worldwide to achieve the millennium development goals for education. The Government of Rwanda received a total of US$70 million from the EFA-FTI CF in 2007 and 2008. The 2007-08 CF Grant was designed within a sector-wide approach and a financing mechanism that transfers the CF grants to a designated account for the financing of the Government's Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP). The EFA-FTI CF Grant assigns an important coordinating and monitoring role to the in-country education sector development partner group, which in Rwanda is coordinated by DFID. Over the past two years, the Bank has been the supervising entity of the CF grant.

The Program will disburse against achievement of specific Disbursement Linked Results (DLRs) in these results areas The development objective of the Priority Skills for Growth Program-for-Results Project for Rwanda is to expand opportunities for the acquisition of quality, market-relevant skills in selected economic sectors. The proposed operation is aligned with themes under the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Rwanda FY2014-2018, which identifies the following areas as a focus for IDA resources: energy, urban development, rural development, social protection and accountable governance15. These areas are further grouped into three themes: Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that is private-sector driven and job-creating; Theme 2: Improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through rural development and social protection; and Theme 3: Supporting accountable governance through Public Financial Management (PFM) and decentralization. Specifically, the proposed operation, which aims to improve skills for job opportunities, supports theme 1 and 2. The proposed operation is also aligned with the World Bank’s Africa Region strategic focus (high quality human capital), and complements other IDA-financed projects in Rwanda such as the current Electricity Sector Strengthening Project, the Urban Development Project , and the Transformation of the Agriculture Sector Program.The World Bank is uniquely placed to support the GoR through this operation given it has supported SDPs across the world over the past twenty years and has undertaken detailed reviews and impact evaluations of different interventions. By supporting an existing program, the operation offers a comprehensive package to establish a system that is demand-responsive, focusing on quality and relevance but also considering access for all Rwandans. The operation will also support the establishment of a robust governance and institutional framework to support skills development.The forthcoming operation builds on the successes of the IDA-financed SDP that closed at the end of May 2016. The project was rated satisfactory at closing and given the achievements of the SDP and the leadership exercised in the region by the Rwandan government in the skills development agenda, the new operation is an opportunity to progress to the next level by developing a more comprehensive, innovative and results oriented approach to skills development in Rwanda. The choice of financing instrument is the PforR given there is an existing program (the NEP), and there are institutions and processes that IDA can support in strengthening the skills development agenda.",0.0106299305

The development objectives of the Second Programmatic Human Capital for Inclusive Growth Development Policy Financing in Rwanda are to support economic stability and inclusive growth in Rwanda by (i) promoting long-term fiscal sustainability, (ii) enhancing coverage and equity in access to critical social sector programs, (iii) enabling learning and development of children, and (iv) strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability for accelerated human capital development. Pillar A, promoting long-term fiscal sustainability, supports the Government of Rwanda’s commitment to fiscal sustainability and continued efforts to create fiscal space for investments in critical social sector and other development priorities. Maintaining state capacity to invest in human development and infrastructure is a necessary requirement of inclusive growth, which requires reforms to create enhanced fiscal space and better management of risks to debt sustainability. Pillar B, enhancing coverage and equity in access to critical social sector programs, strengthens equity in human capital development. It is critical to expand the social safety net coverage and to ensure that the benefit levels of its human capital-focused components are adequate and adjusted regularly. Without this, the real value of the transfer is eroded over time and with inflation, covering only a very small share of household consumption. Pillar C, enabling learning and development of children, supports foundational measures to improve the quality, coverage, and efficiency of critical services for children during their formative years. The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected young children, which highlights the importance of protecting essential services. Pillar D, strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability, commits to strengthening the accountability and service delivery capacity of public institutions and to promote citizen participation in socio-economic development. A cornerstone of this agenda is the deepening of the decentralization process, which is gradually devolving political, fiscal, and administrative power to the district and cell level.",-0.00063461065

The following outcomes are expected: 
(a) Investment climate - by the end of 2007, the Government program supported by DPL attempts to make Ukraine more attractive place to invest through improvements in the investment climate, corporate governance, and financial intermediation.  Considerable improvements in investment climate and corporate governance would be reflected in an increase in the investment ratio by 2 percentage points of GDP (to about 22 percent of GDP), and doubling of the FDI per capita inflows.  The financial sector would further deepen without deterioration of main prudential ratios.  There will be continuing diversification and strengthening of the economy through reductions in cost of doing business, and deepening integration into the world market, including WTO accession. The Program is expected to achieve improvements in the consumer and business services provision, including communications and energy services. 

(b) By the end of 2007, the Government program supported by DPL is expected to facilitate development of a more efficient, transparent and accountable management of public resources consistent with more stable, single digit inflation. There would be better coordination between fiscal and monetary policy, in part reflected by an ongoing dialogue between the Government and the National Bank.  Improvements in public financial management would be reflected in elimination of budget arrears, reduction of tax arrears, streamlining of tax administration.  More adequate and higher quality coordination and information flows are expected between Ministry of Finance, Treasury, STA and Customs Administration.  The quality of internal and external audits, of both sides of the budget (revenue and expenditure administration), are expected to materially approve.  Civil service and procurement standards would gradually converge to EU standards.  SOE management also would improve considerably as reflected by increased SOE profitability levels. As a result of these developments, credit ratings of Ukraine are expected to approach investment grades. 

(c) social inclusion - by the end of 2007, the DPL is expected to contribute to creation of the basis for broad participation of society in the benefits of economic development and reduction of social tensions.  It will be done by encouraging rural development reflected in high quality issuance of land titles, improving the efficacy of social services while increasing the flow of resources to them, developing the mortgage system, strengthening the financial system for local governments, bringing social insurance to actuarial balance without creating undue burden for workers, improving the efficiency and transparency of social fund administration, and improving the targeting of direct social assistance programs. As a result of all these changes, the poverty incidence is expected to further decline by 3 percentage points, with a an even larger reduction in rural poverty, by 6 percentage points. This First Development Policy Loan (DPL-1) will support priority reforms in the social and economic spheres of the program of the Government of Ukraine - ""Action Plan for Meeting the People"". The project design focuses on the institutional and policy changes necessary to implement the reforms, within the context of Ukraine's European Union (EU) integration efforts, and, is a valuable tool in the process of implementing the Ukraine-EU Action Plan. The DPL program, supported by the project, seeks to integrate government, and donor activities under three broad themes to improve public governance: a) investment climate, b) public administration and public finance management, and, c) social inclusion. It builds on a number of accomplishments supported under the Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-2), being concluded in parallel with this loan. However, there are political and economic risks, which the DPL's design will seek to mitigate. Engagement will improve the Bank's capacity to help the authorities make appropriate policy decisions.

PRSC-5 continues to support the Government to implement its comprehensive governance reform program.  A key priority is the consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC series (PRSC-1, 2 and 3) and under PRSC-4 mainly to further refine the regulatory and institutional governance framework which has been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to improve impact of governance related activities.  Additional support will be given to governance reforms, in particular governance challenges in selected entities such as the revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the forestry and the mining sectors. Reforms in these areas will provide an important test for the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing governance framework. Regarding basic service delivery, the objective is to accompany the process of institutional strengthening and quality improvements underway in the sectors.

The overall goals of these decentralizing reform are to (i) improve the regulatory and institutional framework for
decentralization; (ii) strengthen governance and enhance community participation; (iii) support fiscal discipline at the
subnational level; and (iv) continue efforts to strengthen fiduciary management and institutional capacity of all levels of
government. Specifically, the proposed operation aims to (i) establish the conditions for stimulating the generation of local
resources; (ii) strengthen local expenditure autonomy; (iii) strengthen constraints on borrowing, improving upon the debt
restructuring measures adopted as part of the first PSAC through market mechanisms to furthering the emergence of Bolivias nascent
subnational credit market; and (iv) put in place key measures to enhance the transparency of local finances.
 The Second Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit for Decentralization for Bolivia aims to support the Government of Bolivia's ongoing decentralization reform agenda. The proposed operation would be the second in series of Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credits (PSACs). The proposed single-tranche PSAC continues the reform agenda initiated under the first PSAC (report no. P7439), approved by the Board of Directors in May 2001.The comprehensive decentralization reform program aims to adapt the existing institutional framework for improved decentralized public service delivery and governance to implement the Government's poverty reduction strategy. The PSAC program supports the Government in i t s efforts to improve the delivery of public services to the poor and increase the efficiency, transparency and accountability of Bolivia's decentralized government system. Bolivia has taken important steps, including those supported under the first PSAC, but important challenges remain. The present operation supports further deepening of the reform efforts, especially as regards issues of subnational finance and administration. The overall goals of the Government's decentralization reforms are to (i) improve the regulatory and institutional framework for decentralization; (ii) strengthen governance and enhance community participation; (iii) support fiscal discipline at the subnational level; and (iv) continue efforts to strengthen fiduciary management and institutional capacity of all levels of government. Specifically, this project aims to support the critical next steps for a system which has been declared decentralized but in reality remains only partially so. Some of these ""next steps"" include: (a) the transfer of limited local autonomy for tax policy to the municipalities; (b) clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the levels of the public sector in the important electrification sector and setting the stage for greater clarity across service sectors; and (c) the involvement of international credit rating agencies and auditors in assessing the financial well-being of municipalities. The second PSAC assures the continued progress and visibility of Bolivia's efforts to arrive at a point of fully transparent distribution of responsibilities, accountability, evaluation, and control. Future steps along that path are expected to be supported through subsequent PSACs.",-0.06975797

The project has five components. (1) Support to Agricultural Production component will support an accelerated supply response focused on preserving/restoring the productive capacity of 50,000 eligible farming households, to enable them to effectively engage in continued and expanded production of key staple foods in the short - to medium -term (6-24 months). (2) Support to Community Safety Nets component will ensure household food security for sections of the communities affected by job losses, by mitigating the expected shortfalls in their incomes through support for public community-level works. This activity will target 10,000 beneficiaries, and its focus will be on establishing public assets that would contribute to or enhance the impact of support under Component 1, as well as those that foster adaptation to climate change. (3) Support to Risk Mitigation component will explore the feasibility, and then pilot the implementation of locally appropriate market risk management measures for the cashew sector. This will serve to strengthen the resilience of the sector to market risks that the sector is increasingly exposed to (e.g. a price drop in 2018, current disruptions to the global supply chains) and would lay the ground for a sustainable recovery. (4) Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation component will support Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in facilitating efficient implementation of project activities and tracking of results. The component will finance activities related to project coordination and management, including developing annual work plans and budgets, financial management (FM) and procurement, safeguards compliance, project monitoring and evaluation (M&E), citizen engagement as well as a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).

The major purpose of the Human Resources Development Sector Investment Loan Project was to support the first phase of the Government's 10-year Education Reform Program.  Human resources play a critical role in Jordan's economy.  Lacking natural endowments and relying heavily on imports, the country's prosperity depends on human capital earnings.  Since the mid 1980's, Jordan has been losing its comparative advantage in these two areas owing to changing macroeconomic conditions and the qualitative shortcomings of its education system.  The Government recognizes its need to raise the quality of basic and secondary education so as to develop its domestic technological capacity, and maintain its regional comparative advantage in terms of labor services.  It has therefore formulated an education reform program to be implemented in three phases which includes: (a) restructuring the school system; (b) improving the quality of teaching and learning; (c) using sector resources more efficiently and increasing cost recovery levels; and (d) institutionalizing the capacity to sustain sectoral reform.",-0.05852091
