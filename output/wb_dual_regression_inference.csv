The coverage  of existing states under the project is to help these agencies from moving over from development of HIS (as in HP-I) towards use of HIS in water resources planning and management. The PDO will be achieved by : (a) strengthening the capacity of hydrology departments (surface and groundwater) to develop and sustain the use of the HIS for hydrological designs  and decision tools thus creating enabling environment for improved integrated water resources planning and management; (b) improving the capabilities of implementing agencies at State/Central level in using HIS for efficient water resource planning and management reducing vulnerability floods and droughts and thereby meeting the country's poverty reduction objectives; (c) establishing and enhancing user - friendly, demand responsive and easy accessible HIS to improve shared vision  and transparency of HIS between all users; and (d) improving access to the HIS by public agencies, civil society organization and the private sector through awareness building supporting outreach services.  Greater use of an improved HIS is expected to have a broad but definite impact on the planning and design of water resources schemes, from which the rural and urban poor will have secure and sustainable access to water for multi - purpose livelihood uses.
