This program document describes a loan to Georgia to support the Economic Management and Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO). The DPO would support a core set of reforms of the Government of Georgia (GOG) to sustain rapid growth, and ensure greater inclusion, job creation, and resilience by: i) strengthening economic management through improving the efficiency of public resource use; and ii) enhancing competitiveness through introducing evidence-based policy making; promoting more competitive markets; diversifying the financial sector; improving teacher deployment and remuneration with a view toward ensuring a more qualified workforce over the long term; and strengthening investment promotion. The proposed loan, in the amount of euro 45 million, is a single-tranche standalone DPO. The economy also needs to be more resilient, which in turn requires steps to address remaining economic vulnerabilities and mitigate the threats of climate change to livelihoods and key economic sectors. The DPO thus aims to support the Government’s efforts to strengthen economic management and enhance competitiveness to address some of the identified challenges. The reform program supported by the DPO aims to sustain growth, while increasing inclusion, job creation and resilience and rests on two pillars. The first pillar, with a focus on economic management, would support government efforts to improve efficiency of public resource use through strengthened public financial management (PFM) arrangements at the local level, stronger public investment management, and more effective public procurement. The operation has provided a useful platform that allowed the World Bank to engage on and influence the design and implementation of a core set of structural and economic management reforms. It has also paved the way for future engagement in important “second-generation reform” areas such as education, competition and digitalization. The deep cross-sectoral support provided by the DPO has emboldened the reform proponents within the GOG and helped catalyze stronger coordination of the reform efforts across a diverse set of institutional actors. Furthermore, the DPO financing will help strengthen Georgia’s external buffers and signal confidence in the credibility of the macroeconomic framework and the reform program in an environment of heightened external uncertainty.",-0.00012458606,0.03916618

The development objectives of the Second Programmatic Human Capital for Inclusive Growth Development Policy Financing in Rwanda are to support economic stability and inclusive growth in Rwanda by (i) promoting long-term fiscal sustainability, (ii) enhancing coverage and equity in access to critical social sector programs, (iii) enabling learning and development of children, and (iv) strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability for accelerated human capital development. Pillar A, promoting long-term fiscal sustainability, supports the Government of Rwanda’s commitment to fiscal sustainability and continued efforts to create fiscal space for investments in critical social sector and other development priorities. Maintaining state capacity to invest in human development and infrastructure is a necessary requirement of inclusive growth, which requires reforms to create enhanced fiscal space and better management of risks to debt sustainability. Pillar B, enhancing coverage and equity in access to critical social sector programs, strengthens equity in human capital development. It is critical to expand the social safety net coverage and to ensure that the benefit levels of its human capital-focused components are adequate and adjusted regularly. Without this, the real value of the transfer is eroded over time and with inflation, covering only a very small share of household consumption. Pillar C, enabling learning and development of children, supports foundational measures to improve the quality, coverage, and efficiency of critical services for children during their formative years. The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected young children, which highlights the importance of protecting essential services. Pillar D, strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability, commits to strengthening the accountability and service delivery capacity of public institutions and to promote citizen participation in socio-economic development. A cornerstone of this agenda is the deepening of the decentralization process, which is gradually devolving political, fiscal, and administrative power to the district and cell level.",0.04363157,0.07303798

To further reduce costs and leverage private investment in the sector, the program promotes the institutional transformation of the state-owned utility into a commercially-oriented, financially resilient and credit-worthy company by establishing a focused performance contract with the Government and reinforcing its Board with independent directors. In parallel, to foster electricity access in rural areas, the program supports the Government’s public-private partnership (PPP) model by way of a sustainable tariff reform and expansion of the rural concession coverage. In the ICT sector, with an ultimate objective of increasing Internet penetration rate and lowering costs, the reforms, under DPF 1, allowed the entry of three new Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and, under DPF 2, has led to the adoption of a new Telecom Law and accompanying legal provisions that significantly enhance and modernize the regulatory environment, rendering it conducive to fair competition and private sector investment.

The DPG supports the PA’s reform efforts aimed to strengthen fiscal resilience and foundations for private sector investments and ultimately job creation. The US$30 million grant will directly leverage another donor financing in the amount of approximately US$45 million through the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) Trust Fund. The operation also sends a strong positive signal to other donors that directly provide bilateral budgetary support to the PA. While this operation is a standalone operation, it continues the practice started under the previous operation of presenting prior actions in a medium-term reform context. The structure of the economy of Palestinian territories has transformed dramatically over the last two decades. The manufacturing and agriculture sectors’ share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by around 40 percent and 75 percent, respectively, during 1994-2016. The share of public service sector (such as education, health, and security) in national income expanded by around 60 percent during the same period, largely financed by donors. This dramatic structural transformation in the economy has resulted in failure to generate sufficient private sector jobs to absorb the growing labor force (mainly youth and women) and revenues to provide services to a rapidly rising population. However, it is critical to highlight that intensified settlement activities, little progress in internal reconciliation, restrictions on movement, curtailed access to large areas of territory and restrictions on external trade continue to constitute the main impediments to private sector investment and job creation in West Bank and Gaza. Driven by episodes of conflict, poverty rates in the Palestinian territories have increased during 2011-17, with nearly one in three persons living in poverty, and with growing divergence between the West Bank and Gaza. Economic growth, social assistance and a well targeted cash transfer program run by the PA have helped reduce poverty in the Palestinian territories in the years following the second Intifada. However, political instability and multiple episodes of war in Gaza over the last ten years have significantly eroded these welfare gains. Following the 2007-08 and 2014 conflicts in Gaza, poverty increased significantly, pushing up the overall poverty rate in the Palestinian territories. Data from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) shows that the overall share of population below the poverty line has increased from 26 percent in 2011 to 29 percent in 2017. This, however, masks a substantial divergence in trends between the West Bank and Gaza. Poverty rate in the West Bank declined from 18 to 14 percent, while poverty in Gaza increased dramatically from 39 to 53 percent leaving every second Gazan below the national poverty line.",0.013457345,0.084191434

P164289,2018,0.39,0.39,0.0,"Grenada First Fiscal Resilience and Blue Growth Development Policy Credit The series’ Program Development Objectives are to: (i) Support fiscal measures and compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law; and (ii) Support Grenada’s transition to a Blue Economy by strengthening marine and coastal management, marine ecosystem health, and climate resilience. This program document presents the first operation in a programmatic series of two Development Policy Credits (DPC) for Grenada. The First Fiscal Resilience and Blue Growth Development Policy Credit, in the amount of US$30 million, supports the implementation of policy and institutional reforms set out in the Government’s long-term development strategy, the New Economy Plan (NEP), the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) for 2014-18, and Grenada’s Blue Growth and Coastal Master Plan. The Government’s programs prioritize fiscal sustainability, strengthening resilience against natural disasters, and harnessing the ‘blue economy’ as a way to fuel sustainable growth.  This DPC series supports key aspects of that broad program. This DPC series supports a more comprehensive approach to strengthen sustainability and resilience in the context of a small island state. Grenada is a small country (with around 107,000 people) facing structural challenges, high volatility stemming from external factors, and significant exposure to natural disasters. Striking examples include the devastation of Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Emily in 2005 that caused damages estimated at 148 percent and 30 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), respectively. Grenada also suffered a protracted recession during 2009-12, during which real GDP contracted by 8 percent from peak to trough. Combined with a sustained pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance, this led to a steep rise in public debt. This operation takes a comprehensive approach to strengthen macroeconomic, fiscal and environmental sustainability, and resilience to shocks. It does so by supporting the implementation of fiscal reforms that keep public debt on a downward trajectory and support fiscal consolidation. Additionally, it takes a more balanced and sustainable growth approach that safeguards natural resources and measures to better deal with climate change and natural disaster shocks. This DPC series also supports measures geared to implement the ‘blue growth’ approach envisaged by the authorities, which aims at fostering sustainable growth while protecting livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to disasters and climate change. For Grenada, an effective transition to a blue economy is synonymous with balancing the environmental health and resilience of coastal and marine ecosystems with the high economic returns these natural assets provide. Grenada is witnessing a rise in the total contribution of coastal tourism to GDP (to 25 percent of GDP in 2015 from less than 15 percent in 2005). The share of tourism-related jobs has also increased from 14 percent to 23.3 percent (equivalent to 11,500 jobs) over the same period. At the same time, high vulnerability to natural disasters calls for a strengthened institutional approach to disaster risk management and prevention. The second pillar in this DPC series supports Grenada’s transition to a ‘Blue Economy’ by supporting selected measures geared to strengthen ocean governance, marine ecosystem health, and climate resilience.",0.18347485,0.07413942

The objective of the DPL is to help Tunisia accelerate growth, unleash faster private sector job creation and more economic opportunities for the youth by strengthening the business environment, the financial sector, and promoting the inclusion of lagging regions and the youth. The policy pillars supported by this DPL will: (i) follow-up on the unfinished reform agenda supported by the Governance, Opportunities and Jobs DPL series; (ii) engage in new policy areas including fiscal reform, civil service reform, and establishing the foundations for supporting regional development strategies in lagging regions andreforms to create more opportunities for the youth.      Board Schedule Comments The development objective of the Business Environment and Entrepreneurship Development Policy Loan Project for  Tunisia is to improve the business environment, and (ii) support entrepreneurship and deepen access to finance. The proposed Business Environment and Entrepreneurship Development Policy Loan (BEE DPL), in the amount of Euro 457.2 million (US$500 million equivalent), is a standalone single-tranche operation aimed at supporting key areas of reform in the Government of Tunisia’s Five-Year Development Plan for 2016-2020. The DPL would help Tunisia achieve stronger and more inclusive growth and private sector-led job creation, particularly by stimulating entrepreneurship. The Government response to the employment and social challenges by raising public sector hiring and salaries has helped maintain social peace, but has also contributed to significant weakening of Tunisia’s fiscal situation. Going forward, job creation will require a sound macroeconomic framework, a dynamic private sector and a conducive business environment. Accelerating job creation and promoting inclusion and shared prosperity in Tunisia also entails supporting entrepreneurship and deepening access to finance.The proposed DPL is informed by the challenges and opportunities identified in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD). The SCD identified three key development challenges for Tunisia: (a) macroeconomic stability: the macroeconomic and fiscal environment exhibits large vulnerabilities that, if not addressed through deep structural reforms, will prevent the country from achieving its full growth potential; (b) cohesion and security: restoring security and social cohesion are prerequisites for setting Tunisia on a new growth trajectory. Attaining longer-term stability and social cohesion require continuous measures to address the economic and social exclusion of large segments of the Tunisian society; and (c) improved governance: seven years after the revolution, there is still a clear need to increase accountability, improve service delivery and create more effective means for citizens to participate in policy design and implementation. The SCD also identified two key drivers for eradicating poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner: (a) promotion of private-sector-driven job creation, by simplifying regulations, creating a level playing field, improving access to credit and improving efficiency of the banking system; and (b) increased equality of opportunities through transparent policies that reduce skills mismatch, strengthen the social protection system, address spatial inequalities, and target institutional failures that generate unequal opportunities.",-0.0017357203,0.02985119

The Development Policy Loan (DPL) supports the ambitious reform program of the Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) to successfully transition to a competitive and more inclusive market-oriented economy. Reforms supported are organized under two pillars necessary to this transition: (i) increasing the role of markets and the private sector in the economy; and (ii) enhancing social inclusion. The proposed operation is a stand-alone development policy loan in the amount of US dollar 500 million. It follows a stand-alone development policy credit of US dollar 500 million, approved by the WBG Board in June 2018, that supported the initial phase of reforms. The operation is central to the World Bank Group’s overall engagement with Uzbekistan, as described in the revised 2016-2020 Country Partnership Framework (126078-UZ; June 26, 2018).  The operation is in response to a government request for support in sustaining the momentum of market reforms and the economic transition. It is designed around two pillars: (i) increasing the role of markets and the private sector in the economy; and (ii) enhancing social inclusion. The first pillar focuses on actions to increase trade and strengthen financial sector efficiency. It also focuses on State institutional reforms that are critical to the transition, and to increasing domestic and foreign private sector investment in the economy. The second pillar focuses on supporting a more inclusive transition through actions that address constraints to formal job creation and skills development, strengthen safety nets, enhance the voice and participation of citizens in the budget. The operation contributes to addressing climate change through actions that generate mitigation and adaptation co-benefits. The climate and disaster risk screening conducted for the operation highlights that Uzbekistan is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, particularly in the sectors of agriculture, energy and water resource management.

The series focuses on three pillars. First, by enhancing macroeconomic and fiscal stability the operation will help boost investor confidence and free up domestic financing for the private sector and make public resources available for social spending. Second, by creating a more dynamic and commercially oriented energy sector, the operation will improve service delivery and enable a scale-up in private investment. Third, the operation will help improve competition and the regulatory environment for businesses. Implementation of the first wave of reforms under the three pillars was modest at first but has made significant progress since the parliament’s endorsement of the Government’s reform program in April 2016. Against this backdrop, there are high expectations and demands of the population for improved service delivery, sustained economic growth that creates jobs, and better living conditions. This operation is part of an international package aimed at supporting the economic reform program of the Government of Egypt (GoE) to bring the economy back on track amid macroeconomic and social vulnerabilities. The DPF series’ approach to help address these issues is grounded in the World Bank Group (WBG) MENA Strategy, which aims to renew the social contract so that it is based on greater citizen trust; more effective protection of the poor and vulnerable; inclusive, transparent, and accountable service delivery; and a stronger private sector that can spur job creation. The operation builds on the analysis and pillars set out in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Egypt, including the three highest priorities: macroeconomic stabilization, continued energy subsidy reform, and improvement in public governance. The DPF series is fully aligned with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Egypt, which, along with the MENA Strategy, seeks to achieve the WBG twin goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Additionally, the operation is closely aligned with the World Bank’s new MENA Climate Change Action Plan, which commits to support critical policy reforms to remove distortion prices and regulations, open up fiscal space, and catalyze private investments. Although there are important risks, including from the macroeconomic and reform implementation perspectives, the proposed DPF series is expected to play a key role in supporting much needed structural reforms. The DPF is anchored in the Government’s medium-term reform program. The GoE has developed a long-term vision—Egypt’s 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy—and a medium-term reform plan. This medium-term reform plan was developed in consultation with civil society and the private sector and was endorsed by the parliament in April 2016. Significant measures toward implementation of the program have been taken over the past two years, especially in the first half of FY17.  The reform program sets ambitious targets for sustainable, private sector-led growth and job creation, to be achieved by FY19 through reforms grouped under four main themes: macro-fiscal stabilization, private sector-led growth, social and economic inclusion, and transparency and accountability.",-0.014502724,0.23861021

P163284,2018,0.1,0.0,0.1,"Cote d'Ivoire - Second Fiscal Management, Education, Energy and Cocoa Reforms Development Policy Operation  The Program Development Objectives (PDOs) are intended to support the Government's ability to: (i) enhance tax revenue and public procurement; (ii) strengthen efficiency and equity in the education sector ; (iii) improve the performance of the electricity sector and enable private participation, and (iv) strengthen institutional framework and the governance of the cocoa sector. There aims mutually reinforcing complementarities within the three pillars since the creation of additional fiscal space through higher revenue mobilization will help increase financing of education expenditure. Similarly, improved access to electricity will boost private sector activities and help collect additional revenue. The operation is the second in a programmatic series of three Development Policy Financing (DPF) operations. The policy program supported by the DPF series aims at: (i) enhancing tax revenue collection and public procurement; (ii) strengthening the efficiency and equity in the education sector; (iii) improving the performance of the electricity sector by enabling private participation and diversification; and (iv) consolidating transparency in the management of the cocoa sector. The DPF series is closely aligned with the 2016-2020 National Development Plan (NDP) and is an integral element of the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Framework (CPF) (FY2016-2019). The second adjustment is the addition of a third and last operation in the series, to broaden its scope and ensure that all reforms are sustainably implemented over time. The initial timeframe of two operations has proved to be too short given the scope and magnitude of all the reforms embedded in the DPF series, especially with the introduction of the fourth pillar proposed above. By adding one more operation, new reforms have been included to assist further the authorities in their effort to implement key policy actions in mobilizing domestic resources (such as the reduction of tax exemptions), in increasing the efficiency and the quality of the education sector (by increasing the teaching time toward targeted poor performing students), and in restoring the financial viability of the energy sector (by ensuring the payment of all arrears). Such extension also contributes to enhance the probability of achieving expected results by consolidating the reforms in strategic sectors such as energy and cocoa, that may face some resistance from vested interests. Lastly, the incorporation of a third operation to the existing series does not represent a radical shift in the WBG strategy since an annual DPF was already programmed during the full period of the CPF (FY2016-2019). The DPF series aims at supporting the Government in its overall effort to promote sustainable and inclusive growth as well as to increase the economy’s resilience to both domestic and external shocks over the next few years. The Government’s strategy has been defined in the recently adopted NDP for the period 2016-2020, which was presented to the international community at the Consultative Group meeting organized in Paris in May 2016. The proposed series selectively focuses on a sub-set of critical challenges linked to fiscal policy and key sectors for inclusive growth: education, energy, and cocoa. These sectors play a critical role in the Government’s strategy as they have all a significant impact on the life of the poorest segments of the population as well as on the redistribution of income across groups. This selectivity was based on the combination of the Government’s priorities, the recent findings of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and other analytical work, and the lessons derived from previous DPF operations in Côte d’Ivoire and in other low-income countries.",-0.016887626,0.06402337

There aims mutually reinforcing complementarities within the three pillars since the creation of additional fiscal space through higher revenue mobilization will help increase financing of education expenditure. Similarly, improved access to electricity will boost private sector activities and help collect additional revenue.Board Schedule Comments The operation is the first in a programmatic series of two Development Policy Operations (DPO). The policy program supported by the Development Policy Financing (DPF) aims at: (i)enhancing tax revenue collection and public procurement; (ii) strengthening the efficiency and equity in the education sector; and (iii) improving the performance of the electricity sector and enabling private participation. The development policy operation (DPO) series is closely aligned with the 2016‐20 National Development Plan (NPD) and an integral element of the World Bank Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The DPO series aims at supporting the Government in its overall effort to promote sustainable and inclusive growth over the next few years. The Government’s strategy was well defined in the recently adopted National Development Plan (NDP) for the period 2016‐2020, which was presented to the international community at the Consultative Group meeting organized in Paris in May 2016. The series deliberately focuses on a sub‐set of critical challenges linked to fiscal policy, education, and energy. This selectivity was based on the combination of the Government’s priorities, the recent findings of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and other analytical work, and the lessons derived from previous budget support’s operations in Cote d’Ivoire and in other low‐income countries. Other 2016‐2020 NDP priorities, in particular job creation and private sector development, are being, and will continue to be, supported by other World Bank Group (WBG) operations, including the regional DPO on trade facilitation between Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire as well as several investment projects aimed at improving Côte d’Ivoire’s competitiveness in priority sectors such as agriculture and industrial transformation.",0.0136894705,0.08705684

P504910,2024,0.41,0.05,0.36,"Generating Resilience, Opportunities, and Welfare for a Thriving Egypt (GROWTH) The Development Objective is to foster a competitive, resilient and green economy. Egypt stands at an inflection point in its social and economic development journey. While reforms implemented since 2016 had helped improve economic buffers, economic imbalances remained. These imbalances were exacerbated by external shocks leading to capital flight in March 2022 as investors became concerned about the sustainability of policy settings. The revised International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, as part of a collective development partner effort that includes this proposed operation has helped address immediate, short-term financing needs and restore confidence. However, the necessity for significant medium-term reforms to engender long-term recovery underscores the imperative to realign structural reform priorities. This US700 million dollars operation is the first in a programmatic series of three single-tranche development policy financings (DPFs) to support the Government of Egypt (GoE) in addressing current, longer-term economic challenges and advancing a next generation of reforms. The objective is to shift toward more private sector participation, better macroeconomic and fiscal resilience, and a greener growth trajectory that are essential for a reorientation to a more competitive economy capable of sustainably reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Commitment to these objectives is clear in Egypt’s Sustainable Development Strategy Vision 2030 and National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) 2050 which center around Green, Inclusive and Resilient Development (GRID). In addition, the Egyptian State Ownership Policy (SOP) regulates the state’s ownership and participation in economic activities, aiming to enhance the private sector’s role in the economy. The United Kingdom has expressed interest in extending a guarantee to IBRD (US200 million dollars), which will expand the initially planned US$500 million IBRD loan amount, bringing the total operation to US700 million dollars. The Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) also intends to provide US300 million dollars in parallel finance linked to the same reform matrix, with its approval expected within months of this DPF, bringing the total lending to US1 billion dollars.

The proposed First Equitable Growth and Job Creation Development Policy Financing is designed to help Jordan lay the foundations for a higher and more sustainable economic growth path, while creating more jobs for Jordanians and non‐Jordanians. The post‐2011 refugee influx has deepened Jordan’s labor abundance, but it did not alter the structural pattern of job creation Currently, job growth is concentrated in low productivity sectors with localized markets and limited attractiveness to efficiency‐seeking investment. Going forward, Jordan is seeking to build resilience into its economy by raising productivity, expanding domestic markets through improved access to finance and stronger institutions for managing risk, and opening new external markets. Jordan's previously successful formula for coping with geopolitical challenges has run into new trends of lower grants, remittances, and investment flows. While the new government will have the benefit of a fresh start on building consensus for reforms, it faces heightened uncertainty over the summer, necessitating accelerated international support. Although Jordan’s adaptability in hosting refugees is intrinsic to its history, the economic context for the latest influx has posed particular challenges. Recent poverty data are not available, but earlier declines in poverty are likely to have halted or even reversed for Jordanians. Jordan's response to the country’s productivity, jobs, and conflict spillover challenges is to seek international support for the fiscal costs of the spillovers, while using that support to catalyze reforms capable of generating productive jobs in a labor‐abundant economy. The Government of Jordan (GoJ) is putting together a five‐year priority reform program for equitable growth and job creation whose objective is to set the foundations for higher growth. The program responds to the challenges of prioritizing and implementing reforms that Jordan has included in its strategic documents in the past. Jordan's Vision 2025 was developed in 2014 and has been under implementation since then. The Vision promotes a balanced approach to development and sets out goals for improving social outcomes, the business environment and the functions of government.

This program document proposes the second and final operation in a programmatic series of two Development Policy Financing (DPF) operations designed to support energy and fiscal reforms in Burkina Faso. Fiscal performance has, however, deteriorated, and fiscal space for Government’s ambitions to address large deficits in infrastructure and social services has narrowed. Improving the financial sustainability of the sector and leveraging private investment in cheaper electricity sources is critical to extend reliable and affordable access to electricity. Diversifying the energy mix towards least cost options, namely solar and affordable imports from neighboring countries, will gradually bridge the gap towards full cost recovery electricity tariffs, thereby reducing the need for recurrent transfers to the sector. By attracting private sector in electricity generation, the Government intends to focus scarce public resources on the access agenda. Sector creditworthiness is critical to crowd-in commercial financing in new and cost-effective generation capacities, which would ultimately help secure the delivery of more electricity to households and firms, and therefore lay the basis for greater growth and better living standards. This strategy is fully aligned with the World Bank Group (WBG) principles of the ‘cascade’, to optimize the use of limited concessional resources by enabling private sector participation to deliver sustainable and affordable infrastructure services. The DPF series is closely aligned with the 2016-2020 PNDES and an integral part of the WBG strategy. It has been prepared in coordination with other partners, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and incorporates results of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD 2016), lessons from previous development policy operations in Burkina Faso and other low-income countries as well as results from past and ongoing analytical work.

The objective of the Gas-to-Power Project for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is to increase the amount of electricity generated in Afghanistan and to leverage private financing for the country's energy sector. The project has three components. A) The proposed Project comprises the development, financing, design, construction and operation of a 40MW green-field gas-to-power plant as an IPP on a Build-Own-Operate basis. It will be implemented by Bayat Power Electricity Services Distributor Company (""Project Company""), a Special Purpose Company established by Bayat Group. The Project Company is 100 per cent owned by Unique Market Holdings Ltd., a British Virgin Island12 registered company. The latter is 100 per cent owned by Bayat Energy Group LLC, a Delaware registered company, whose ultimate owner is Dr. Ehsanollah Bayat. As a whole, the Bayat Group has been operating in Afghanistan for 17 years, and owns and operates several enterprises in Afghanistan, primarily in the telecommunications and media sector, but it has also engaged in oil and gas exploration, and production. The corporate structure is further detailed in Figure 5 of this document. B) The power plant under the proposed Project will be located 20 km east of Sheberghan, and approximately 1 km west of the amine treatment plant (operated by Afghan Gas Enterprise (AGE)) at the Yatimtaq gas field in northwestern Afghanistan. The specific plot of land, on which the project site is situated, is Government owned, and has been leased to the Project Company under a lease agreement signed on 31 July 2018, coterminous with the initial term of the PPA (i.e., five years after the plant's commercial operations date). Due to its location, the power plant will supply power to Jawzjan (Sheberghan is its center), Faryarb, Sar-i-pul and other parts of the provinces in the Balkh region. It is consistent with the 2013 Power Sector Master Plan, which identifies this as the least cost option for increased domestic energy generation (up to 150 MW of installed capacity by means of gas-fired power plants). The Project Company has entered into a five-year take-or-pay PPA with DABS, under which it will sell electricity at a fixed (non-indexed) tariff of US cents 7.5/kWh. This is slightly higher compared to the average cost of imported electricity, which ranges from US cents 5.5/kWh to US cents 6.5/kWh over a five-year period due to indexation, but is lower compared to the recently closed Kandahar Solar Project, which has a tariff of US cents 8.5/kWh. C) The proposed Project will consist of one 40MW mobile gas turbine generator designed to burn natural gas. The balance of the plant will include a gas distribution and filtration system.

The increase in the amount of the operation from the initial US$20 million credit is intended to support the government’s strong policy efforts to adjust to the twin shocks from the Ebola crisis and the slump in commodity prices in a way that builds resilience and contains the debt. The operation is the third in a programmatic series of four single-tranche operations to support the implementation of the government’s Agenda for Transformation (AfT), which remains Liberia’s extant medium-term strategy even in the aftermath of the Ebola crisis. Liberia’s primary development challenges, which the AfT launched in 2012 aims to address, relate to sustaining the peace, achieving economic transformation, developing human capital and improving governance and public institutions. Addressing a history of exclusion, inequality and corruption is critical to sustaining the peace in Liberia following nearly 15 years of conflict. This challenge is complicated by the exit of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the limited fiscal space for scaling up the government’s security apparatus. Economic transformation, critical for achieving inclusive growth is constrained by weak infrastructure, including electricity, roads and telecommunication that limits connectivity to markets, and consequently increases fragility. Liberia’s low level of human capital development also limits access to economic opportunities. To support the government in addressing the primary development challenges, the operation focuses on three principal areas: (i) governance and civil service reforms; (ii) economic transformation; and (iii) human capital development. Within these three areas, the operation is selective of reforms that directly or indirectly address the issues of fragility and conflict. Consequently, the operation focuses on reforms that are expected to contribute to: (i) improving transparency in key aspects of government operation; (ii) increasing accountability in the management of public assets and reducing opportunity for corruption; (iii) building capacity for equitable service delivery, and (iv) enhancing inclusive growth and employment opportunities.",0.051406696,0.08925557
