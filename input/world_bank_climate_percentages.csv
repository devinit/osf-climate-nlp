<br />
The PDO will be achieved through a combination of strategic investments, capacity building, and policy dialogue. The pastoral population includes all people (active and inactive persons of all ages) who are members of a livestock-keeping household that: (i) obtains at least 90 percent of its animal feed requirement from grazing natural vegetation and (ii) derives at least 50 percent of its income from livestock. The agro-pastoral population includes all people (active and inactive persons of all ages) who are members of a livestock-keeping household that: (i) obtains 10 percent or more of its animal feed requirement from crop residues and (ii) derives at least 50 percent of its income from cropping activities.<br />
<br />
The main beneficiaries of PRAPS will be pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal; specific trans-boundary geographic areas and transhumance axes are prioritized in each of these six countries. The proposed project is expected to benefit 2,070,000 people directly (200,000 in Burkina Faso, 400,000 in Chad, 440,000 in Mali, 400,000 in Mauritania, 400,000 in Niger, and 230,000 in Senegal) whose livelihoods rely mainly on pastoral activities, including but not limited to livestock keeping or marketing. Target groups include women and youth, who will benefit from the project&amp;rsquo;s overall activities and from activities specifically addressing their needs whenever possible. Secondary beneficiaries include service providers (both public and private), as well as national and regional institutions. CILSS will be a major institutional beneficiary of this project, alongside CRSA (Centre R&amp;eacute;gional de Sant&amp;eacute; Animale, the ECOWAS Regional Animal Health Center, based in Bamako) and other regional coordinating partners at the technical level.

As a medium-term objective, the APL series pursues reducing the infant and maternal mortality rates by one-third, as per the proposed indicators for the Program. 
 
Under APLs I and II an important set of policies and interventions were developed to strengthen the performance of the public health services. These policies and interventions aimed to improve child and maternal health status, including expansion of the insurance system (the Universal maternal and child insurance, SUMI, at present), the investments in primary health care, and the strengthening of cost-effective health interventions (PAI, IMCI). APL I introduced a basic health insurance (the Seguro B?sico de Salud, today SUMI) to reinforce provisions to mothers and children, and a new vaccination system and set of new management tools. APL II is implementing an expanded version of maternal and child insurance, by supporting the deployment of mobile health brigades (EXTENSA) as a way of expanding service delivery to underserved areas, and new management tools (performance agreements, and demand-driven investment policy) are being used. The Government has provided sustainability to health insurance as well as to the EXTENSA program that is now being absorbed by the regional and/or municipal budgets. The EXTENSA Unit in the MOH that was part of the APL II PIU is being incorporated in the structure of the MOH.  All regions benefited with support from investments, mainly in primary care. 
 
The proposed APL III aims to sustain the trend in improving the IMR and accelerate the reduction of the MMR, which a recent modeling exercise shows to be a challenge. APL III would consolidate the strategies implemented under APLs I and II by:  i) strengthening the regulatory capacity of national, regional and local levels to perform critical EFPH; ii) promoting the demand of maternal and infant health services through developing and enhancing the culturally appropriate maternal and infant health referral network; and iii) supporting implementation of the new expansion of the insurance system (Universal Health Insurance - SUSALUD.",0.0,0.0,0.0

During the course of the year the Government will update their National Plan (PRSP).  This operation will align with measures identified in the revised plan.  It will also build on the 2010 Economic Recovery DPO, by focusing mostly on policy measures that will sustain economic growth, maintain comptitiveness, and improve the investment climate for Government of Moldova to achieve their broader vision of increased trade and integration with the Europena Union.  The design of the operation will be based on findings of AAA work within the Bank and IFC, notably the CEM, Doing Business, DTIS, and the BEEPS.
 
 To generate competitiveness, a main emphasis of the operation will be on improving the investment climate to generate productivity gains.  Proposed polciy measures and policy dialogue under the operation will build on firm-level producitvity regressions undertaken under the CEM to identify the main investment climate impacts on productivity.  This work will be undertaken in collaboration with IFC's Investment Climate Advisory Services and Doing Business Teams.
 
 In addition to growth and competitiveness, the operation will consider measures necessary to increase savings for new investment.

The debt has grown rapidly principally due to high fiscal deficits (which have grown from 2.6 percent of GDP at the start of the economic crisis to around 6.7 percent of GDP in 2014) but also due to high state support to public utilities and SOEs. There is an urgent need to put public finances on a sustainable footing via, among others, tackling the structural issues - in particular reducing the ineffective direct state subsidies and guarantees - that have often been called -- for public utilities operating in energy (EPS), roads and railways. A sustainable reduction of the subsidies and state guarantees to these SOEs in turn requires reforms to make them financially viable and operationally effective.The government recognizes the need to tackle these structural issues. Fiscal consolidation and improved expenditure management are at the core of both the Fiscal Strategy and the National Economic Reform Program, which include the stabilization of the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of 2017, the completion of privatization and a stop to the issuance of guarantees for liquidity purposes to the remaining SOEs. The WBG will support the government with the achievement of sustainable fiscal consolidation and expenditure management, through the proposed policy-based lending, which will be firmly anchored in the ongoing Public Finance Review (PFR) for Serbia.  The PFR is to be completed by June 2015.

44000-P127433,"First Development Policy Loan This is the first in a proposed series of two development policy loans supporting Poland's goal of strengthening public finances. The proposed DPL program is central to the Bank's engagement in the country in the area of public finance reform, as described in theCountry Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) presented to the Board on June 7, 2011. The CPSPR highlights that the DPL program is expected to support Poland's fiscal consolidation agenda, while strengthening fiscal institutions and improving the efficiency and sustainability of social spending. 
The programmatic DPL is structured around three pillars with the following development objectives: (i) consolidating public finances to ensure a steady decline of the fiscal deficit to stabilize and over the medium-term reduce public debt to maintain favorable access to financial markets; (ii) strengthening fiscal institutions through the introduction of fiscal rules to ingrain a prudent fiscal stance over the medium term; and (iii) advancing long-term fiscal reforms to secure the sustainability of social spending in view of Poland's demographic challenge. The measures proposed to be supported under each pillarare as follows:  
Pillar 1 Consolidating Public Finances: Sizable fiscal consolidation is a key policy priority for 2012.  Buildingon the progress made in 2011, a further reduction in the fiscal deficit is crucial to adhere to Poland's commitment under the Excessive Deficit Procedure, to stay clear of the 55 percent of GDP national public debt limit, and to protect priority spending.
Pillar 2 Strengthening Fiscal Institutions: Through the introduction of fiscal rules, the Government aims to ensure that once the fiscal deficit has come down after the initial consolidation process, it remains at prudent levels over the business cycle. The Government plans to introduce controls on local government finances in the form of an annual aggregate deficit ceiling. In addition, a new national level fiscal rule would limit the growth of national government expenditures to a rate not exceeding the trend growth rate of GDP. These rules would safeguard against the re-emergence of excessive structural budget deficits in the medium and long term.
Pillar 3Advancing Long-Term Fiscal Reforms: Strengthening public finances also requires Poland to initiate structural reforms across various sectors. These reforms are focused on helping to secure the sustainability of pension transfers and public health care services, while improving the coverage and generosity of social assistance for the most vulnerable. In addition, introducing a regular income accounting for farmers will enable moving to a system of regular taxation of the agriculture sector based on income, including for the payment all social insurance contributions over the medium term.

The change of political leadership following the swearing-in of President Barrow constitutes an unprecedented opportunity for the people of Gambia, and for its policymakers to embark on a reform process to restore fiscal and external sustainability and lay the groundwork for a robust economic recovery. This first transfer of power through a democratic process since independence is predicted to yield noticeable political and economic dividends especially as diplomatic isolation has been lifted.  The new authorities face a number of challenges. In addition to the need to assure rapid reconciliation among political and ethnic groups, the new government must confront severe legacy economic problems √¢¬Ä¬ì with a fiscal deficit for 2017 predicted to be 10%, 112% of debt to GDP, debt service absorbing half of all revenues, and less than one month of reserves √¢¬Ä¬ì the economic situation is dire.  The ability of the new administration to deliver and show results is critical to ensuring a smooth transition and the World Bank can play a critical role. 
The WBG engaged with the incoming authorities one week after the results of the elections. President-elect Barrow called for a close collaboration with donors, especially the WBG, and asked for the Bank assistance in shaping the economic recovery program of his administration. During a subsequent mission, the Minister of Finance confirmed the new government√¢¬Ä¬ôs request for an emergency DPO that could both provide urgent relief, support critical fiscal consolidation, while protecting the poor and vulnerable and laying the groundwork for a robust economic recovery.  
The overall objective of the emergency Development Policy Financing is to support a return to macroeconomic stability, boost economic recovery and mitigate social impacts of the crisis. 
The Bank is working in close collaboration with the IMF and other partners.Board Schedule Comments",0.0,0.0,0.0
